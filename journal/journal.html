        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Well...Here's how it goes...according to 
          Stacy, whom I have spent all day with. And so, once upon a time, in 
          a galaxy far, far away...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><em><img src="../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          I convinced Chris to let me do his journal today.....CRAZY CHRIS called 
          me at 9:15 this morning to wake me up to go to church with him....but 
          by the time he got there he was disappointed to find that i hadn't found 
          an &quot;appropriate&quot; shirt to wear yet....so he picked one out 
          for me (that i hated) but we went to church anyway...(relatively new 
          experience for me) and it wasnt half bad....</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><em>After church we decided to come back 
          to his house which didn't last long cause i convinced him to go to my 
          house and we watched &quot;The Three Ninjas&quot; THE BEST MOVIE EVER...but 
          i fell asleep cause he woke me up so early in the morning....and we 
          ate Braum's Cookies-n-Cream Ice Cream which made me happy casue its 
          my favorite....</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><em>We came back to his house and I read 
          his journal...(very sweeet). Natalie (who seems VERY cool) called and 
          asked if we were going to Evening Church so Chris decided we would and 
          we did...and then after we hung out with some people from the church..I 
          wish i knew their names since i hung out with them...but regardless 
          i liked them and i had fun...</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><em>We came back to his house and just hung 
          out...and that was pretty much our day.....</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><em>Stacy &lt;3's Chris foreva....</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Ok, this is how it <em>really</em> went...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Last night I told Stacy that she was going 
          to church with me in the morning, and that it started at 10:50, and 
          I was coming to her house at 10:15...so she needs to wake up accordingly. 
          She said, ok so that means that I have to wake up at 9:15...since I 
          don't have an alarm you will have to call me. And so I did, at 9:15 
          on the dot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">When I got to her house, she was still deciding 
          on what shirt to wear - I mean, she has a million and they were all 
          over her bathroom floor, and she couldn't find just one? Come on...so 
          I picked out a shirt, and we left. When we got to church there weren't 
          many people, but there was a substantial amount of youth there for a 
          Sunday morning (at least compared to the last Sunday morning that I 
          went when the youth minister resigned).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">After Church we went back to my house to 
          get something to eat. I was going to cook some stuffing and some chicken 
          or meat or something, but my dad got on to me and suddenly I wasn't 
          very hungry after it. I don't understand why I couldn't cook some of 
          those things...no one else in my house cooks but me if I feel like it...everyone 
          else is either at work, or too tired to cook something major like that 
          during the week. Anyway, I ended up eating just a couple sandwiches 
          and some chips and chewy chocolate chip cookies. When I had finished 
          my lunch, Stacy wanted to change out of the shirt I had picked out, 
          because it was long sleeve, so we went back to her house, and there 
          we say Lauren's new boyfriend, Clay.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I must say that when Stacy and I had talked 
          about him over the phone, he seemed like a loser, but I met with him 
          and he has a friendly personality. However, after spending the day with 
          him, and hearing some of the things that goes on in his life, I can't 
          say that I like him much. He is kinda strange...like eery strange. Anyway, 
          Lauren will listen to me one of these days, until then, she will just 
          learn the hard way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">We watched 3 Ninjas while we were there, 
          because it came on tv, and after that we left to come back to my house 
          to do homework. While I read for my Brit Lit class, Stacy got ahold 
          of my journals on my computer, so I told her how to navigate throughout 
          the site on my computer, since I wasn't online, and she read nearly 
          everything that had happened to me from the time I started the website, 
          until my latest journal entry.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Natalie called about this time wondering 
          if I was going to come to church tonight, but I hadn't planned on it. 
          However, since I had Stacy with me, and she wanted to meet Stacy officially, 
          I decided to go ahead and go. The sermon would be borning tonight, since 
          it was a character analysis of Issac. So unfortunately, I started nodding 
          while I was listening to the sermon. It was so emabrassing...but I remedeed 
          it with some Breathstrips. They have a potent bite to them, so I put 
          two in my mouth and chewed them into my chewing gum. That kept me awake. 
          Natalie and Stacy also met tonight. It was nothing spectacular. I did 
          feel a little self-conscious about putting my arm around Stacy since 
          Natalie<em> was </em> sitting right behind me. But I did it, and it 
          didn't matter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Natalie invited us to go to her house and 
          go swimming after church. I totally forgot that she had a swimming pool...however, 
          Stacy doesn't like to get in a bathingsuit. So I told Natalie that, 
          and that I would come on a night that Stacy was working. She was cool 
          with it. So Stacy and I went with the preacher's daughter, and some 
          other kids to Wendy's and then to the park to have a picnic. We played 
          on the swings and with a football, until the mosquitoes kept eating 
          at me. So we left, and headed back to my house to, once again, try to 
          do homework. But that didn't happen too much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">In Brit Lit, we are reading all kinds of 
          poems and I am not too up on deciphering what the poet is talking about 
          so I just put them aside, and read my journal with Stacy. She thought 
          it was sweet and interesting. The fact that she thought it was interesting, 
          was interesting to me. I always considered my life to be boring and 
          generally uneventful. However, the people that I talk to really enjoy 
          reading my journal entries. I just simply don't have the time to do 
          everything that I want to in the day. So I just update it now when I 
          have the chance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I took her home, and then called her and 
          talked until I fell asleep. So I guess I will do my homework in the 
          morning. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey Guys,</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I am sorry that I haven't updated my journal 
          in about 20 days. I have been really busy. But I have found a free moment 
          to do it now, so I will. Let's see...what have I been up to?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Stacy and I are still together, and going 
          strong. We celebrated our 1 month anniversary on the 11th, and that 
          went well...it was a hectic time since that was the same weekend as 
          my birthday, my dad's birthday, and Father's Day.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I started school at TCC on the 2nd of June, 
          and am taking British Literature and US History Pt. 2. They both require 
          a lot of reading, and I didn't even consider that before I signed up 
          for them. So, needless to say, my schedule was in a crunch. I told my 
          boss at Braum's that I needed time to be able to study. So they put 
          me on the schedule 6 days a week, every night. I had a test at the end 
          of that work schedule, and I couldn't take them doing what they were 
          doing to me anymore. So I quit. It seemed to me that they were going 
          to string me along like Dairy Queen did with the whole &quot;Assisstant 
          Manager&quot; job. I was about to be promoted by the District Manager, 
          and then we got a new General Manager, and he said that I had to prove 
          it to him before I could be promoted. &quot;Puh! I had already proved 
          it to YOUR boss, why do I need to prove it to you?&quot; So, that Monday 
          night, the day before my test, I quit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Lauren had also quit a couple days before 
          that, because she couldn't take the job anymore either. So that leaves 
          Stacy there by herself. She wanted to quit too because there was nothing 
          there left for her to look forward to at work. She tried to find a job 
          at a drug store, but they messed her around on the applications, telling 
          her they would be in, and then saying, &quot;Oh, we aren't hiring right 
          now...&quot; Buttholes!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I got my palm pilot finally on the 5th. It 
          has been the neatest thing ever. The only problem that I have with it 
          is that I can't connect to the internet with my $100 modem card that 
          I bought for it. I don't know if it is the cable or the card, or I just 
          don't have the right phone number for a dial-up connection. But I have 
          been taking it every where I go, and I take notes on it at school now.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I got my computers now, and had to spend 
          a good 4 days fixing my XP computer. I have found out that the A: drive 
          doesn't work on the one that I got from Dairy Queen, and neither does 
          the modem. But those are easily fixable, since I believe I have an extra 
          one of each of those somewhere...I just have to get them put in the 
          right way. I seem to have a problem adding hardware to my computer. 
          It just doesn't work properly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, that is about all that has happened 
          to me. I am going to apply at a Diary Queen in Arlington tomorrow morning. 
          I should have no problem getting a job, except that they aren't hiring. 
          So I will really have to sell myself, with the fact that I have managed 
          my own before, and still have all the uniforms, and am already trained. 
          So I would be an easy hire, and a good choice for the job that they 
          don't know they need filled. I am also going to go to the mall and apply 
          at some clothing stores. I want a full-time job, because I am used to 
          the big paychecks, but I don't have time for one. I don't really even 
          want to go to school, I am just doing it so I can put off paying for 
          my student loans so soon. Oh well...I know that I should be going to 
          school and get an education so that I can make more money later, and 
          do the things that I have planned for me to do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Now that I have found some &quot;free time&quot; 
          - yeah, right - I am going to do a little work on the site. I have added 
          new music to the home page - it is .wma files, so that is windows media 
          audio. I don't know how well it will work with y'all who do have windows, 
          or for people using netscape, etc. But if it doesn't, then great, it 
          will probably load faster. If you have any problems with it, then put 
          a message in the forums about it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I am also undelighted to inform everyone 
          that the Freeform Frog store will not be opening so soon...if at all, 
          because of the finances required to run the store. When they started 
          it, it was entirely free, but now they are charging a percentage of 
          the sales, and I don't know if I want to invest that money (that I don't 
          have, by the way) into something that may or may not go over so well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">So that is all for tonight. I will try to 
          get this updated, at least every other day from now on, and thus the 
          archives will be monthly, not biweekly. Laterz.</font></p>
