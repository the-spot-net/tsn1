        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Man...I did not want to 
          wake up that early this morning. Over night, it rained and lighteninged, 
          and I got up to look at it out the window, but this morning, I didn't 
          remember it, but had the urge to watch the news. I figured out why though 
          shortly afterward.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The person that opens the 
          store in the morning was 15 minutes late today. So we had to wait until 
          she got there before we could go inside. To start the day, I had to 
          fix the fryers. No one else knew what was wrong with them...so it is 
          usually up to me to do some of the trivial maintence around the store, 
          because I am the only one that knows how to &quot;southern-engineer&quot; 
          different setups to that we can continue work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got to work the grill 
          today. I enjoy cooking because I don't have to deal with stupid customers, 
          and I don't have to break my wrist scooping ice cream. Plus there is 
          the fact that I can get a burger out in 20 seconds if I have everything 
          prepared before I get the order. And it frusturates me when the slow 
          people are cooking, and could care less about rushing to get someone 
          their food. Needless to say, I left in a better mood today. I did get 
          to take a sandwich home with me, but during the ride, there were a series 
          of bumps, and one of them caused the bottom of my bag to fall out, and 
          I ran over my burger and fries. So I didn't get to eat that. *sigh*</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I did get to see Amber today. 
          She came up to work, either to get some food, or her paycheck. She looks 
          nice out of uniform. I didn't get to say hi to her, because of the people 
          around, and the fact that anything I did to show interest in her would 
          cause a problem from the on-lookers. So, I just stayed in the grill 
          doing busy work. She works tonight, but I got off at 2:30.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I got paid today, 
          and my check for my last two car payments will be in the mail tomorrow. 
          Then on Monday, I will go to take my driving test, and fax my stepdad 
          a copy of my DL, so he can transfer the title to me. Whoo Hoo! I will 
          finally have a car, and will finally be able to go on real dates. I 
          anticipate having it by the 14th of May...but that may be sooner or 
          later depending on how long it actually takes to get me to become the 
          owner of the car.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I talked to Beth today, 
          and she registered for the site. She is going to try to come to Arlington 
          on my Birthday, June 13th, and I guess she and I will go to Six Flags 
          or something that day. I dunno, the possibilities will be nearly endless, 
          since I will have my own mode of transportation. I haven't gotten to 
          talk to her in nearly a month. It was good to hear from her, although 
          we don't have the same quality conversations that we used to have. We 
          still do think the exact same things at the exact same time. For example 
          today, we both typed the same &quot;got to go&quot; type message, at 
          the exact same time, and sent it. Then I had answered her question about 
          when I would be online later before she asked it. We call it the &quot;Page 
          Principle&quot; because we are always on the same page.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I was going to try 
          to find some new forums to post in, but I had better get to bed. It's 
          getting dreary. Laterz.</font></p>

          working with all that much. I don't get to work with Stacy until Friday, 
          and I don't get to work with Amber until Friday either. *sigh* I need

          It is a cajun restauranta. I liked it, but that is because I enjoy eating 
          spicy foods. I ordered the shrimp and catfish combo. Everything was 
          good except the service, but that was because the waitor had a party

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ugh...work. I was pretty 
          upset most of the day, and I don't know why. I honestly don't know why. 
          I suppose it was because I had to go to bed earlier than I wanted to...but

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway...I worked the drive 
          through today, and it was a pain in the butt with no runner. I don't 
          have much to say about today concerning actually working. We were pretty 
          slow because of the rain, and then we only had about 4-5 people on the

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I do, however, have some 
          insight on the Amber and Chris rumor. According to Diana, Amber was 
          the one that approached Diana and asked if Lauren and I were still dating. 
          I don't recall what Diana's response was, but she knows that we are 
          not. And according to Diana, the rumor was started by Amber. An interesting 
          twist to everything. I have yet to give her my phone number, but I have 
          two copies, one for each girl so that they can talk to me and get to 
          know me before we make any sudden moves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Before that, Diana asked 
          who all comes in today, and I told her that Amber does, and she immediately 
          asked, &quot;So what, are you dating here now?&quot; Man, that called 
          for a fast and curt retort &quot;NO! I am telling you who comes in next! 
          Sheesh...&quot; I really can't stand people being in my business, especially 
          when it doesn't involve them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, it's late now, and

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today...work, again. Hopefully 
          this day will be better than last Sunday. Shortly after I got there, 
          I was asked a question, flat out. &quot;Who are you dating up here?&quot;...by 
          one of the other crew managers. <br>
          &quot;No one! I am not dating anyone here.&quot; .oO(Dang, why are people 
          all in my business?) <br>
          &quot;Ok, because it is going around that you and Amber are dating,&quot; 
          she says.<br>
          &quot;No, we're not. She doesn't have my phone number, and I don't even 
          think she knows my last name. We're not dating. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          &quot;<br>
          &quot;Well, it's going around that you and her left together Thursday 
          night. I just wanted to check with you. Rumors fly around here....&quot;<br>
          &quot;Ok, I am not dating anyone up here. Lauren and I are finished...and 
          just friends I assume. So that settles that...you can squash any more 
          rumors you hear.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The main focus of today's 
          work was the interesting conversations and exchanges that I had with 
          Stacy. It is amazing what one deduces from someone else asking a simple 
          question. Last time she and I worked together, she was talking about 
          how she was upset with her boyfriend, and how he was &quot;going to 
          get it.&quot; So, I naturally asked how things went when I saw her next. 
          Man, oh man...&quot;I don't have a boyfriend anymore,&quot; she says. 
          .oO(Hmm...interesting.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We spent the rest of my 
          shift working the drive through. It was fun. We exchanged comments through 
          the headsets, and in person. It was your typical flirtation. Oh well...I 
          didn't mind. She is the girl that I originally liked when I started 
          there anyway. But I didn't think too much of it, until she wrote on 
          a piece of paper &quot;Chris *heart* Stacy&quot;, and pined it to my 
          apron. I took it off and folded it up, saying &quot; I can't let anyone 
          see this...I have enough rumors floating around the store about me as 
          it is.&quot; And I then held on to it for a while, and after a few minutes, 
          put it in my pocket...so she wouldn't think I was being mean and rejecting 
          the idea.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Now, I haven't decided what 
          I want to do with this new development, but I think this is going to 
          be another experiment, with a couple variables: a sister of a former 
          date...a girl I have worked with...and someone that showed interest 
          in me first. (as well as the odd family history that she and her sister 
          have.) But this approach will be different. I am going to take this 
          one slow. And not exclusively...because there is another development 
          on my left: Amber.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Concerning Amber, I have 
          a couple queries. First, why does she care if I was dating Lauren? Second, 
          who would have started a rumor that she and I are going out? Third, 
          why was she so seeking of my approval of her interests? I am sure that 
          in time all these questions will be answered.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After work, I went home 
          and rested. About 9:45 I got online and started working on my site, 
          and some logos for it. I talked with the creator of www.splatt.org, 
          and found out one of his new features on his site: an online site merchandise

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ok, so I didn't make it 
          up at 8:00 this morning, but I did get out there by 8:45. That is when 
          my dad opened the garage door and started the work. I pulled weeds, 
          picked up hedge clippings, mowed, weed-eat-ed, and then....I had to 
          wash the car.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I was expecting to do it, 
          just not today. But it was ok, because about that time, my stepsister's 
          friend came over, and he helped with the car washing. (nothing racist 
          or anything, but he is a black dude, and black guys know how to wash 
          a car. Their's are usually always clean.) So I was glad that he came 
          to help. It would have taken me a long time to do it by myself. Then 
          my stepsister wanted her car washed. So...we started to scheming.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We decided to do it this 
          way: I took the bucket of soapy water and poured it on there. Then we 
          told my stepmom to get her so she could move her stuff from the outside 
          so we could vacuum. I was rinsing the soap off when she came out. When 
          she opened the car door, I soaked her something fierce, and she shrieked. 
          Hehe...her mom went inside right after she came out, and locked the 
          door so my stepsister couldn't get back inside. Her friend and my dad 
          stood by laughing. Then I had to tell her that &quot;She'd been Punk'd&quot; 
          (like on MTV's series &quot;Punk'd&quot;). Ha...good times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My dad and I cleaned out 
          the garage today, and took at least $1200 worth of old clothes to the 
          Salvation Army...it took two trips to get it all. We didn't finish these 
          chores until about 6:00, and by that time I felt dirty. I hadn't taken 
          a bath because I expected to just do the lawn today. Man...so I took 
          a shower and got dressed up and wanted to go out somewhere. I really 
          wanted to go skating, but I was told that it would be a teeny-bopper 
          hang out since it was a Saturday night. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My stepbrother came by for 
          his prom. They drove in a stretch F-350 Truck limo. It was tight. There 
          were 12 kids all together that pitched in to pay for it. They were had 
          their prom at the Arlington Convention Center, even though they live 
          in Grandbury. The whole picture thing only lasted about 5 or 10 minutes...long 
          enough for everyone to have a restroom break and get a couple pictures 
          taken.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After that we all went to 
          Braum's to get some ice cream and then my stepsister and I went to Putt-Putt 
          and played Arcades. I found a game in there that would get you 5 tickets 
          for every token that dropped when you added another one to the pile, 
          or would give you a jackpot of tickets if you made it into the slot. 
          I played most of my tokens on that, and ended up winning 160 tickets. 
          I didn't know there were games that gave double tickets though, otherwise 
          I would have played them. Due to the lack of anything good in the way 
          of prizes, I bought 16 Fireball candies at 10 tickets a piece. It cleaned 
          them out of the on-shelf stock, and they had to get more to fill my 
          order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After that I came home and 
          worked on the site. I have discovered the call letters for this site: 
          T-S.N and a logo is something that I have been working on in my head 
          for a while, but have now put on computer. It's a frog. The slogan: 
          &quot;It's funner with the frog.' The new logo will be on the T-S.N 
          Link page, and on the Home page for all to see for a few weeks/days.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">That's all for tonight. 
          I have to go to work at 9:00 tomorrow morning, so I had better get to

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning I woke up to 
          my stepsister knocking on my door, informing me that she is making biscuits 
          and gravy for breakfast. Mmm...that sounds good. So I hit my alarm for 
          a 8 minute snooze. When I get up, I see her stirring a lumpy paste around 
          in a pan with a wooden spoon...&quot;I don't think the gravy is working 
          very well...&quot; she says. So I take over, and show her how to make 
          the gravy. It turned out rather well. It did have a bit of a bite to 
          it, since the sausage was hot, and I did add a substantial amount of 
          pepper, so it wouldn't taste like flour.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After that, I went back 
          to bed. I set my alarm for 1:45 p.m. and woke up briefly at 1:20 to 
          hear my stepsister leaving. .oO(She's late for class...she had to be 
          there at 1:00...what was she thinking?) But I turned over and went back 
          to sleep. I was having an interesting dream...it was something along 
          the lines of a number of celebrities, and friends that I didn't know 
          I had, and people I have yet to meet...gathering at a house resembling 
          a combination of my dad's and some place else. But just as we all sat 
          down to eat lunch, the alarm went off, and I had to wake up. I got ready 
          and everything by 2:20, so I could leave at 2:25, in case of wind resistance. 
          When I put my watch on, it said 1:20... .oO(Oh, I must not have set 
          it for daylight savings time....wait a minute this is my work watch...how 
          did we getout on time last night if it is wrong?) At that point I realized 
          that somewhere along the lines I must have set the clock an hour forward. 
          Dang, now I have an hour to kill, that I could have been sleeping.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So I played Frogger 2 for 
          a bit, and beat it. Then I got on the internet and checked out my site. 
          We're doing prety well with the amount of posts being made daily, and 
          the amount of new members arriving. I have been informed that we reach 
          across the US, from Washington State, to Palm Beach, Florida, and as 
          far north as Canada. Exciting news indeed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work today, I chose to 
          work the drive through, and set everyone's positions for them to work 
          tonight. I worked with Lauren, and realized something extremely disappointing 
          - again. I was played. I knew it when that dude came to take a break 
          with her on Sunday. My mom was right about girls that will reveal their 
          entire family history to you on the first date. They are messed up in 
          the head somewhere. A sad thing about it is that I hear that her sister 
          is the same way with guys. *sigh* Two beautiful girls, both messed up 
          when it comes to relationships. I must say that it is very frusturating 
          to me to see people that have the right way put in front of them and 
          they do their own thing. I now know how my parents felt. *sigh*</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I have heard another good 
          report on Amber from another Crew Manager that knew nothing about the 
          events of yesterday. According to this crew manager, she believes Amber 
          to be the type of girl that doesn't chase after guys, and is independent 
          when it comes to getting what she needs. But that she also doesn't get 
          much attention from guys. For example, her ex...if he had any intention 
          of getting back together with Amber, then he would have called her by 
          now...she hasn't heard from him in a couple months. So, I will give 
          her my number, and maybe she can make use of everything that I have 
          to offer a girl...like a guy that actually cares about the girl.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I ran out of Braum's 
          tonight with my apron on backwards and my bike helmet on my head like 
          a superhero...my cape flapping through the rushing breeze of the parkinglot, 
          and my dad sitting in the truck busting out laughing at my retarded 
          commotion. It was a burst of energy, and at this point, I really don't 
          care what people think about me. I have a lot of frusturation built 
          up inside of me, and I need a release. Working at Braum's for 6 days 
          straight, plus dealing with a dishonest girl, and everything else I 
          have to put up with is wearing me out. So I am going to do something 
          - some day soon, that will let me release my stress...I thought about 
          golfing, but that is expensive, and I don't have any good clubs anymore. 
          I need something physical, something to throw, or kick - that I won't 
          have to go get when I am done with it - and that won't cause me additional 
          physical pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I'll think about it...but 
          right now, I have to go to bed. I need to get up early (8:00) to work 
          on the lawn in the morning. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, today went by quickly. 
          That was because I was up until 4:30 this morning working on my journal 
          and the site...as well as chatting on IRC with some newly made friends. 
          We got several posts and a couple new users on the forums though, which 
          is a good thing. We have accomplished goal #1, to be a site for people 
          all over the country. We have our first out of state member - LogDog. 
          He is from Washington State.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I started to register for 
          UTA in the fall, because I need to get the information on the classes 
          that I will need to transfre to there from TCC. But their application 
          is 10 pages online; I only got to the 7th though before I had to get 
          ready for work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I could have sworn I worked 
          with Lauren today. But I didn't. In fact, Lauren, Stacy, or another 
          lady didn't even show up for work last night. So now none of them can 
          come back to work until they talk with Tom. I am curious as to whether 
          or not Lauren will even talk to Tom about it because of the number of 
          times she has told me she wanted to quit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Also tonight, I was confronted 
          by two other crew managers about my dating Lauren. So I had to be blunt 
          with them and tell them that we only dated once, and that due to the 
          fact that I have been unable to contact her in the last three days, 
          she and I are done. I am considering us just friends as we were before 
          we started this expirement. I don't mind losing a girl this time, I 
          guess because I am the one to decide that it is over. Whether or not 
          she wants to continue a relationship of sorts, is up to her. But until 
          she calls me, we are just friends. And now they know that, and will 
          be able to squash any rumors that have arisen over the past couple days.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I found out some stuff about 
          Lauren and her dating practices in the past tonight from one of the 
          two crew managers, as well as the insight that not too many of the other 
          girls there like her. According to the crew manager, it is because she 
          is an attractive girl and all the guys want to &quot;talk&quot; to her, 
          and because she dated one of the guys there (who is recently terminated) 
          and they liked him. So it was a bitter experience. But it doesn't matter 
          much to me. I did like her, and still do. It was just an expirement 
          to see what would happen...and now I know - for this instance. Like 
          I said, I am open to changes, but am going to do my own thing until 
          something else presents itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">On a similar note, that 
          same crew manager was intent on hooking me up with another girl. The 
          one that I thought was too conceited , in her own words. Well, she asked 
          her, of her own volition, and came back with the information that she 
          is not going to date any one while she is a Senior in HS, but wouldn't 
          mind &quot;talking&quot; to me. So, guess what...I will give her my 
          phone number and see what she does with it. This should be interesting 
          as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Now, I know that some of 
          you (who have read the forums and know me personally) are wondering 
          what the heck is he doing...or thinking &quot;he is stuck on getting 
          a girl friend.&quot; Not true. I am interested in making friends...if 
          a girlfriend becomes of it, so be it...it couldn't hurt. But at the 
          moment, I don't know anyone here well enough to make such leaps in relationships. 
          I do have a lot more to say about other people that I am interested 
          in, but do the chance that certain people might read this, I must abstain, 
          or cause myself a significant amount of grief.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">On the way to work, the 
          wind was against me the entire time. I felt like calling in, and saying 
          that I couldn't make it. But I kept thinking...I will get there, I may 
          be late, and I may be worn out, but I will get there eventually. I can't 
          get fired for a no-show...that would be stupid. I used my frusturation 
          energy to pedal through the wind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work today, I got tired 
          of not knowing where anything was, and seeing everything in disarray. 
          So, today it started. I have taken the liberty to arrange everything 
          in the store to it's proper place. I have done the office/store room 
          and I did the Freezer. In the office, I put all the things back on the 
          shelf where their stickers are that say what number to scan when restocking. 
          Doing that I realized that we are out of a lot of things. So I told 
          the other crew manager that in two weeks, I want to do the inventory 
          through the third week so that we won't run out of things so much. I 
          believe that I can do a significant job as far as keeping a good stock 
          on hand. I also arranged the ice cream squares in the freezer. They 
          were all out of order, and now, though they may not be in their correct 
          spots, they are all grouped, so at least you can tell if we are out 
          of something.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The Stars played the Mighty 
          Ducks tonight in hocky, and they went into the 5 OT...the 4th longest 
          game in history. Unfortunately though, they lost to the Ducks. 4-3. 
          Oh well, I don't follow hocky anyway, I just thought I would watch that 
          since it was going to be historic.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today was easier than yesterday. 
          Even though I had to get up at 7:00 in the morning to get to work on 
          time, we were incredibly slow. That was due mostly to the rain. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We had a manager's meeting 
          this morning, and it was then that I realized that I am the only other 
          manager that is a male, than my manager. Everyone else is a female. 
          So, needless to say, we were in the meeting for 1.5 hours, because the 
          girls wanted to talk about all the little problems and wouldn't shut 
          up. Oh well...we did cover some material concerning cleaning and employee 
          procedures.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I organized the letters 
          for the marquee today as well. They are all out of order and it took 
          forever to find the right letters for the sign that I had to change.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got off, it was drizzling, 
          so that was interesting to ride in. Fortunately, I brought my trusty 
          etbu poncho. HA, right, that thing is worthless for riding a bike in. 
          Anyway, I got home and was a little wet. So I called Lauren, and guess 
          what...she wasn't home. I guess she hadn't gotten home from school yet. 
          Work had called her in for 4:00 instead of 5:30, so I don't guess she 
          would have had much time to talk to me anyway. It's ok...it is getting 
          bad though, because my memory of her complexion is starting to wear 
          off...and I am having a hard time remembering her face. It's nothing 
          wierd, I just haven't seen her in while, and hadn't seen her all that 
          often before now to have a permanent image in my head. Oh well. I'll 
          work with her tomorrow. We'll see what happens.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I did talk to Jay tonight, 
          and he has an interesting approach to his girl that is interested in 
          him. He says that he just wants someone to spend time with, and take 
          getting into a relationship slowly, so that he is sure it is the person 
          he needs to be with. I totally agree, and that is what I have been trying 
          to do for the longest time. All I want right now is someone that I can 
          call up and go hang out with. And a couple weeks, months, etc down the 
          road, I am looking to make it into a true boyfriend/girlfriend relationship 
          - old fashioned way. I don't want anything serious...just a committment 
          from a girl that I will be the guy that she spends her exclusive time 
          with. She can have guy friends, but I would like to be there if she 
          is going to go hang out with them...it is called making mutual friends. 
          And I would invite her to come and hang out with my friends, guys or 
          girls...it won't matter to me to have her along. I just don't know why 
          girls these days are so flaky at times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Benji and I worked on getting 
          me to chat on IRC with Trillian in the anime-kingdom room. It was pretty 
          neat. It did cause a lot more members to join my site, and about 10 
          more posts to be made. The site is finally turining in to what it was 
          meant to be, a place for everyone to hang out at.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Oh man...I don't have much 
          to say about today. It was pretty smooth at work. I worked the Drive 
          Thru, and then learned how to count the drawers and do the paperwork 
          tonight. Easy easy stuff. I didn't call Lauren tonight, because I didn't

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got home

          two hours that I spent with her. We covered all kinds of topics, like 
          her &quot;predicament&quot; as well as mine, and for the longest time, 
          our relationship. I gave her the behind-the-scenes info on how we ended 
          up being friends. She had no idea that it was so complex of a planning 
          that I put into it. I worked at it all semester, networking through 
          all my friends that she knew, and finally got to the point where I could 
          just ask her to the movies, and that was how it all started, for her.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got up early today. I 
          was surprised, so I went back to sleep for an hour. I got online and 
          worked some on the site, and chatted a little. I talked to Amy about 
          the situation, and she put her 2 cents in. I also put my 2 cents in 
          about her situation. From what it looks like, if I end up with someone, 
          it will be because we have been friends for a long time, and they realized 
          all too late (but better late, than never) that I am perfect for them. 
          *sigh* Here's to another 7 years of being officially single, and unofficially 
          taken.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I, for some strange reason, 
          got in the mood to clean my room today. I was a little disappointed 
          when Lauren came over on Friday, and my room was a total mess. I had 
          clothes everywhere, and trash all around the trash can. It was a disaster. 
          So, I guess after writing dates that we were both available to do things 
          on my calendar, I got to thinking of her, and decided that if she did 
          come by, my room was going to be clean. So now it is, and it looks nice 
          too. I also wrote a tenative date for getting my things, otherwise I 
          won't ever call.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work today, it was all 
          interesting. I worked the drive thru, and only the drive thru. It was 
          quite an experience. The cars just keep coming, more frequently than 
          at DQ. And it makes it extremely difficult when I don't have a &quot;runner,&quot; 
          to go make the ice creams and drinks for me while I take the other orders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight, a girl named Amber 
          was my runner. Before tonight, she rarely spoke a word to me. But someone 
          told her that Lauren and I were talking...my guess would be Diana, or 
          one other person...and now she had opened up to talking to me too. However, 
          she smokes, drinks, and was shocked that I don't have sex. She says 
          that there aren't many guys these days like that. Anyway, she is single 
          and has a very conceited opinion of herself. But she is interesting 
          to talk to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I called Lauren on my break. 
          I wanted to see if she would be able to come up there and hang out with 
          me for a little bit while I was on break, but she was busy (probably 
          eating dinner) and asked if I could call back in a few minutes. I didn't 
          - primarily because right after I said I could: <em>click</em>. No &quot;goodbye,&quot; 
          or &quot;I'll talk to you later.&quot; So, I'll call tomorrow or something, 
          maybe Wednesday. If she wants to talk to me, she knows she can call 
          me too.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I am making headway on my 
          crew leader training. I counted my drawer down tonight, and I was only 
          -$1.42 short. Which by the other drawer standards, is pretty good. I 
          think it was off because there were three people using the register. 
          I'm not too worried about it though.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, it is past my bed

          for church while I was asleep. He didn't wake me up doing it, but when 
          he left the door knocked against the frame twice, and that did wake 
          me up. I said &quot;Come in&quot; twice, but no one came in, so I had 
          to get out of bed and go see if someone was at my door or not. No one.</font></p>

          <img src="../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15"> **[

          now. My clothes are in Arlington, I am in Grandbury (1 hour away). It 
          will take at least 30 minutes before we are ready to leave Grandbury. 
          Ugh...this will shorten my vacation by about 2 hours. Next time if I 
          am not home, I am out of town...because they will have to understand 
          that if I am not scheduled to work, I already have plans. It's not like 
          it was in Hubbard, where I didn't do anything but work. I have a schedule, 
          and work gets in the way. At DQ, I didn't mind coming in all the time, 
          in part, because I had nothing else to do, and also because it wasn't 
          as much &quot;work&quot; as Braum's requires.......Oh well though, at 
          least this will let me get Lauren's things to the store before she gets 
          there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I get to work about 9:23, 
          and put away her things. Fortunately no one sees me carry them in or 
          put them away. However, my next task is dealing with the punk truck 
          driver that brings in our groceries. There is a lot of trash outside 
          the back door, and they need to get their cart through there. So I clear 
          a path big enough for his stupid cart to go through, and...&quot;it's 
          not big enough.&quot; So I tell him that our dumpster is full, and he 
          will just have to make due with it...take the carts in and out one at 
          a time, if he has to...he's a reasonably intelligent guy, he'll figure 
          it out. But no, the other crew leader, Diana, has to come out and move 
          more things around. Whatever. I don't care, I am going back inside to

          much to my disappointment, she wasn't as happy as I thought she would 
          be about them...but oh well - she gave me a hug, and that is about all 
          I expected at work.) I invited her to come over after work and we could 
          play a game with my family, or get in the hot tub to realax after work, 
          and she accepted at the time...later she got more and more tired of 
          working&nbsp; and just wanted to go home and sleep.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">It wasn't too long into 
          the course of the day, though, that I noticed Stacy was more open to 
          talking/flirting with me. Apparently they had talked about Lauren's 
          and my date. This would mean one of two things: Stacy either thinks 
          that this is a nice guy that is dating my sister, or this is a guy that 
          I want to get to know more about for myself. I don't know which, but 
          I am not complaining, because I have not met any of Lauren's family 
          except Stacy - I have only heard nearly all of Lauren's family history.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, everything went well 
          until Stacy took her break. Then a guy came in and sat with her while 
          she was on break. As soon as she got off, Lauren was anxious to go on...after 
          I had worked to get our breaks at the same time, pushing mine back later 
          in the day <img src="../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . .oO(Hmm...let's see what happens) They start out sitting across the 
          table from each other, talking, which was fine. Diana asks, &quot;Are 
          you jealous yet?&quot; My answer: &quot;No, not yet, but if he doesn't 
          go soon we might have problems.&quot; So she goes over to find out who 
          this guy is and what they are talking about. According to the information, 
          they are just friends from Government class, and are talking about cell 
          phones.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">No sooner than Diana leaves 
          the table, the guy moves over to Lauren's side and sits next to her. 
          So, I have to keep a closer eye on them - Diana tells me that Lauren 
          keeps looking back her - (I am not sure why she is looking; either I 
          may think bad things and she is worried, or they are sneaking and don't 
          want me to know.) But I never see her look back - thus, she never sees 
          me look at them. So they are sitting, talking...that's cool. But what 
          isn't cool is the move he pulls on her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">He leans over to tell her 
          something in her ear, and steals a kiss on her cheek. (Now, I may be 
          making too big a deal of it, but kissing is something, I thought, you 
          don't just do with anyone....<img src="../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15">) 
          So at that, I tell Diana what happened, and that she is taking the grill, 
          I am taking my break.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I go over to sit with them, 
          and - no introduction. It doesn't matter, I already know who the guy 
          is; but does he know who I am? It comes up in conversation with another 
          employee that is just coming on the clock, about where Lauren got her 
          gifts from, and it was me. Maybe the guy knows now. It doesn't matter. 
          The whole time I was preparing to say &quot;All right dude, she and 
          I need to talk, so would you mind leaving? You'll see her on Monday 
          at school, if you don't call her before hand...but I won't see her.&quot; 
          But before I could, Diana came over and ended our break. Which was a 
          good thing, because I didn't really want to start a big mess with this 
          Mexican kid and Lauren getting upset.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">She walks him out and gives 
          him a hug (which was fine), but what wasn't fine was that she returned 
          the kiss on the cheek <img src="../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . I can't have this be a mutual thing. **[ <em>Rhymes with&nbsp; </em>Bucket 
          ]**, I don't care anymore. When she came in, I told her what I saw, 
          but she tried to play it off... <img src="../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15">. 
          She told me that she was possessive about her boyfriend messing with 
          other girls...I thought it was a good thing because then she would understand 
          that I wouldn't want her messing with other guys. I wonder what would 
          happen if Amy were to come up there and I gave her a kiss because I 
          hadn't seen her in so long? The fit would hit the shan, I'm sure.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, everything was fine, 
          until the next crew leader came on duty. She informs me that I have 
          to stay an extra hour. I can't do that...I am Lauren and Stacy's ride 
          home. Stacy had been sitting at the table since 4:00 when she got off. 
          I have cleared it with Diana that I am to get off at 6:30, as well as 
          Lauren. Nope...we have to stay. I have to stay until 7:00, Lauren gets 
          off &quot;in 20 minutes&quot; now...which is 5:30. Then she tells Lauren 
          that she has to stay until 6:30 now. Ok, so it is busy until 7:00, so 
          we don't leave until the cone line is diminshed. At 6:57, she tells 
          Lauren that she has to now stay until 8:00. I don't give a **[ love 
          ]** and clock out at 7:00 because I have plans that I need to get to, 
          plus the fact that I am tired, and don't care to be here any longer. 
          She is wanting to quit, and has been all day. So I tell her to tell 
          the crew leader that her ride is here, and she has to go. But she doesn't.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The thing that makes it 
          so much more difficult was that there were other people that weren't 
          working that day that could have been called in to work. And, in addition 
          to that, there were two crew leaders sitting on their butts in the office 
          with another employee that was lazy anyway.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So Lauren doesn't leave 
          at 7:00, and ends up staying until 8:00...big mistake. Now they make 
          her stay until 9:00. If you don't put your foot down on some things, 
          then the people will use it against you to get what they want. Or maybe 
          I just have a rebellious personality anyway. I believe it was because 
          all the crew leaders are my equals as far as ranking goes, and the only 
          person that is above me is Tom, Tess, and Diana. Anyone else can't really 
          tell me what to do. And when the one crew leader told me that I <em>had</em> 
          to stay late, I informed her that I don't <em>have</em> to do anything. 
          .oO(I don't even <em>have </em>to work here. I only work here because 
          I think I can make this company run better, and I have impressed the 
          big shots. However, the lower eschelon does not care that I was hired 
          as an Assistant Manager, and then could only be hired as Crew Leader 
          becaue I am under 21.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, Lauren asked me 
          to call her when she got off, so I did and we talked about a couple 
          things...one of which was sort of a let down, but needed to be addressed. 
          She considers us to be in the &quot;Interested&quot; stage. I don't 
          know if she knows what that means, but according to the forum on this 
          site, Interested means that the people are interested, but don't want 
          to commit to anything, or be exclusive.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Now, based on past experience, 
          this would be the same as &quot;I don't really want to date you again, 
          but I will be your friend.&quot; So far Lauren has done everything that 
          I have encountered last semester at etbu with my dates: touchy/flirty, 
          canceling plans, hidden plans, only &quot;interested,&quot; so, based 
          on the trend, I would now enter a woman-hater week and end up with another 
          girl that doesn't want to commit to anything, but ends up being a extremely 
          good friend that exchanges advice with me on dating and such. However, 
          knowing this, I have a better plan this time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I am not going to cop out 
          on Lauren, and I'll just be her friend. I told her that if she want 
          to go do something then to let me know, because I don't want to be the 
          only one that asks to do something, and then when she does want to do 
          something, and I don't call, I get in trouble. So, I won't ask her to 
          do anything in particular, just once a week to see if she wants to go 
          somewhere. I'll call her, and be her friend, but I am finally going 
          to put my knowledge to use. And for this knowledge I have to thank 5 
          of my good friends (which are girls, coincidently): Sarah G., Jamie 
          J., Laura C., Nicky H., and Amy M. Thanks girls.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Having said all this, I 
          am now going to bed. *sigh* Hopefully it will be better in the morning. 
          Laterz</font></p>

          I got up early to get ready for the day at my grandmother's. But I was 
          the only one that got up early. I had to wait until 10:00 when we left, 
          so I did my laundry for Sunday when I have to come back to go to work 
          <img src="../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif" width="15" height="15"> . 
          There is one perk though, at least I will get to see Lauren. However, 
          I fear that this working situation may not work out...things could be 
          bad or good...hopefully good.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got to drive the entire 
          way to Grandbury in the Blazer. It was extremely windy, but it wasn't 
          too big of a deal. When we got there, there wasn't much to do, so the 
          adults talked, like always, and I took a nap shortly after their conversation 
          ended.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We played Sequence, which 
          is a card game and a board game. It was pretty fun; I had learned to 
          play it in college with the RAs. We also played a good game of Hand 
          n' Foot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterwards, I went to the 
          store and got Lauren's Easter gifts. I got her some yellow flowers (I 
          am sad to say that I don't know what type they are, but they are pretty). 
          I also got her a yellow bunny, some chocolate, and a card that says 
          &quot;Happy Easter, from your Easter <em>Honey</em>&quot;. I, of course, 
          got the approval of a couple girls before I bought the stuff. I told 
          my dad, &quot;This is how it's done...&quot; and walked over to a small 
          group of girls, and said &quot;Excuse me girls, I would like your opinion 
          on these things...which one would you like to get?&quot; Easy as that. 
          But I only did that with the card, I picked out the flowers and stuffed 
          animal and chocolate myself.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I went to Tan's with 
          my dad, which is a Mongolian Grill restaurant. There you get to choose 
          your own frozen meats, fresh vegetables, and make your own marinade 
          for the food. Then you take the food to the big circular grill and put 
          6-7 people's orders on there at once and cook them. They move the food 
          around in a circle with a spatula (not mixing each order) and then scrape 
          it off onto your plate....the best part about it is that it is all-you-can-eat. 
          But if you don't know that when it is your first time, you are lible 
          to get a lot on your first trip and won't have to go back for seconds. 
          It is a good idea to get a little bit, and then go back for seconds 
          so you can try new things before you get full.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Before I left, and while 
          I was on the road, Braum's called in, and wanted me to work from 12-3 
          this afternoon. Seeing as how it was a little past 11, I wasn't going 
          to be able to come in...I was already on the road to Tan's and l just 
          about there, plus the fact that my clothes weren't washed. But if they 
          had called 30 minutes earlier, I would have probably been able to come 
          in. I also had to make a lot of phone calls today: FAFSA, my HS, and 
          Lauren <img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15">.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Lauren was supposed to work 
          today, but she told me that her sister was going to cover for her, so 
          I asked her to the movies. We went and saw Malibu's Most Wanted, with 
          Jamie Kennedy. It was hillarious. It wasn't exactly a spoof on 8Mile, 
          but it wasn't bad either. The deal is, his dad is running for governor, 
          and the kid keeps messing with the campaign. So the dad's campaign crew 
          come up with a plan to have the kid kidnapped by a couple of actors, 
          pretending to be gangsters (more correctly called &quot;wangsters&quot; 
          for those of you that can find and appreciate the humor in an ibonical 
          correction), and hold the kid for ransom. The purpose of the kidnapping 
          was to &quot;scare the black out of him.&quot; They told the kid that 
          his dad wasn't going to pay the ransom, and when the kid flopped at 
          a rap-war, he had nothing to live for. From then on, the kid took control 
          of the situation when he found out that the whole thing was a setup. 
          And there is still a half a movie left, so I won't tell anymore of it, 
          you will have to go see it. It is has a lot of out of place slang usage 
          by the white kid (named B-Rad, or Bradly).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, back on the subject 
          of Lauren. After the movie, we came back to my house and she met my 
          parents. This would be the first girlfriend that I have ever shown to 
          my parents before I was shown to her's. We had steak for dinner, and 
          then played some Frogger 2 on the playstation. After dinner, we watched 
          a little tv and talked. There is nothing on TV, ever, but she likes 
          to watch CSI, Grounded for Life, Friends, and Lucy. She's an interesting 
          girl, with an interesting background. So dating me (not to sound pompous) 
          would <em>literally</em> be a different experience for her. Everything 
          else, I am going to leave to your imagination. And trust me, there is 
          an &quot;else.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I 
          kept waking up around 7:00 - 8:00, which is highly unusal for me, since 
          I only had gotten about 5 hours of sleep at that point. So I went back 
          to sleep, but forgot that I had turned my alarm down so that I wouldn't 
          hear it earlier, and almost didn't wake up in time to do my laundry 
          before I had to go to work. Other than that I just lounged around the 
          house while my clothes washed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I put Nix and Will

          guess he was hungry, which is not harmful for him, it was an organic 
          sponge. Hopefully they won't kill each other, or try to again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, going to 
          work today had it's ups and downs. When I got there they put me straight 
          to work: &quot;Chris can you help me take the trash out...(and there 
          is a butt-load of trash bags when the trash needs to be taken out)&quot; 
          &quot;Chris, will you go do the lobby?&quot; AJ came in today (he is 
          my bosses boss) and my boss, Tom, told me that AJ really likes me. Tom 
          didn't tell me why in particular, but he did say that he has mentioned 
          a few things to him about me, and that he always sees me working/cleaning 
          when he comes in. AJ wants to get me promoted asap, but Tom told me 
          some reason why it isn't happening as fast as it should...something 
          along the lines of the managers not being there at the right times. 
          I dunno, it seems to me like an excuse <img src="../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15"></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">One the plus side, 
          my careful planning and stylish &quot;mac-ing&quot; has paid off. Tonight 
          I worked with a girl that I have had my eye on since the first day I 
          worked: Lauren. She is the older of the two sisters there, and she and 
          I talked quite a bit tonight. So much so that we are probably considered 
          &quot;talking&quot; after I call her tomorrow...allow me to explain 
          (I know you want juicy details...sorry, this story is well done <img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15">.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When she got there, 
          I had already been there for a couple hours. She came in as out of uniform 
          as possible to show everyone how she looks in civilian clothes (I do 
          it too...<img src="../images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15">). 
          Anyway, she was lookin good - hair down and everything. Then ALL night 
          - flirting. Splashing water on me, pinching me, touching my arm, making 
          comments to me, on and on until she had to go home. So I decided to 
          make something of it. (I might as well...this doesn't happen to me all 
          that often.) Here's how it played out...</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">She was ordering 
          some food, and employees have to punch in their SSN to get the employee

          &quot;What's your number?&quot; I asked ambiguously.<br>
          &quot;I'm not going to give that to you...*smirk*.&quot;<br>
          She does though, to type in her order. Later I ask &quot;How are we 
          going to date if you aren't going to give me your number?&quot;<br>
          &quot;You haven't asked for it...&quot;<br>
          &quot;Sure I did, when I took your order at the counter...<img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15">.&quot;</font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana"><br>
          &quot;Oh, hehe <font size="3"><img src="../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15"></font>...ok.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So the soap opera unfolds, 
          and is told...with, I'm happy to say, a happy ending spelled out in 
          10 digits.<strong><font size="3"> </font></strong><font size="3">Well, 
          I suppose you want to know a little bit about this girl that has captured 
          my attention (since it doesn't happen on this scale very much, and the 
          female qualities that interest me are somewhat of a mystery to most 
          of my friends). Well, she is from Boston, moved her about 7 months ago 
          (so that would be September, thus she has NO IDEA how hot this summer 
          is going to be.). She lives somewhere in Arlington, but in the Mansfield 
          school district. And she will graduate HS in December. That is just 
          about everything I know about her. So, I'll keep you posted on the publicly 
          kosher happenings of the relationship...maybe <img src="../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15">.</font></font></p>

            it this morning, but my step-sister woke me up this morning for the 
            strangest reason. Apparently it is possible to get your hair caught 
            in a blowdryer. Interesting. Anyway, I got up to cut her hair for 
            her, and then went back to sleep until 12:00 or so.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went to TCC 
            today to apply for admission now that I have my college transcript. 
            It only took about 2 minutes to get accepted. Then I tried for financial 
            aid, and I have to have the FAFSA people put TCC as a financial aid 
            info receipient. That should take about 3 days. I also have to get 
            my HS transcript from Hubbard so that they won't make me take the 
            TASP test, or a lower math class than I took in ETBU. I really don't 
            understand why they don't just accept my math class that I have on 
            there as a good enough one to prove that I don't need to take the 
            tasp. I made a 30 on my Math part of the ACT, and math is not something 
            that I just forget - so it should still be valid. I dunno...I guess 
            I was just ticked off because the stupid line for the registrar's 
            window took forever.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also can't 
            take all the classes I need at this campus, but hopefully I will have 
            my car by then. And another bad thing about the class scheduling, 
            is that they are M-Th, day and night that I would have to take my 
            classes, so it will be really hard for my job to work around my schedule. 
            *sigh*</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Speaking of job...it 
            was really windy today, so I didn't bother to make the trip to Braum's 
            to get my paycheck. It's only for about $50, so I can wait until tomorrow 
            to get it when I go in for work. Also, that girl hasn't called yet. 
            It could be that I was on the internet most of the afternoon, or that 
            she just doesn't care to call. No big deal really...just interesting 
            to see what she does when someone accepts her inquiry about their 
            telephone number. I will take what I have learned from this and apply 
            it to future scenarios.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My step-brother 
            came by tonight, unexpected. So, I didn't go to church tonight, plus 
            the wind was bad, and I didn't have a ride. I didn't want to bother 
            Natalie, since I thought she didn't have her license yet, but she 
            told me she did when she called me tonight.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I worked a little 
            (well, a lot) on the site tonight. I bought the name www.the-spot.net 
            , but it won't be ready until tomorrow. It is set up to point here, 
            but it just hasn't registered with the main nameserver. I also fixed 
            the problem with the logging in/out that kept frusturating me, as 
            well as made some new graphics.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">*sigh* one of 
            my friends from etbu is drunk...it's very disappointing. I hate to 
            see people screw up their bodies like that for a momentary high or 
            buzz. Most of the time you won't remember what you did while you were 
            drunk, and because of that, it is just a waste of money on expensive 
            (or even inexpensive) alcohol. And then they brag about it to their 
            friends, and wonder why none of them care to talk to the person while 
            they are drunk. I wouldn't.</font></p>
