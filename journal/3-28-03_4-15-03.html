        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went to bed at 
          5:00 this morning. I was up late working on the forums for the site. 
          Man, was I reluctant to get out of bed for work. I had to go in at 11:00, 
          which meant that I had to leave at 10:25. But I am kinda glad I went 
          today. A couple things happened of interest...</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">First, we got a 
          new guy today. He's not much for making food, but he has worked for 
          Mail Boxes, Etc. So he was very minimally trained by the manager, and 
          others. So I worked with him some, and he can make a couple food items.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Secondly, and most 
          interesting to talk about...two girls came in today to get some ice 
          cream. I thought to myself...hmm, they're kinda cute - I'd better go 
          away and let someone else take their order. (I don't like to be very 
          forward) So I did, and what happens? The girl with the biggest crush 
          on me at work, comes over to me and says &quot;do you want me to hook 
          you up with one of my friends? I told them you were single....&quot; 
          Huh, interesting thought. &quot;I dunnoooo...&quot; So I thought about 
          it, and came to this conclusion...They go to Bowie high school - they 
          asked for my number - they apparently think that I am worth talking 
          to - ok, we'll do an expirement: This doesn't happen too often to me, 
          so I will give them my number, and see what comes of it. But I am not 
          going to persue it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I gave them my 
          number (via the mutual friend) and then they want to take one more look 
          at me before they leave. So I go to the counter to take care of some 
          business, and catch the look that one of them has on their face: from 
          what I know about girls, it means &quot;Ha, yeah right...he doesn't 
          have a chance.&quot; It is the look that a girl gives to another girl 
          to speak without speaking, but I saw (and tried to pretend not to look 
          - I don't know how effective it was, but that's what I did). So, I didn't 
          expect them to call tonight - and they didn't. So that's that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I did a lot of 
          work on the site tonight...mainly in the graphics part of the forum. 
          I got the smiles, avatars, and some of the icons updated and functioning. 
          I also advertised it a little. I now have 5 people registered. I am 
          sure that more will come as word gets around. Hopefully I will be able 
          to beat the number of people I have for the etbustudents.cc site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also talked to 
          Nicky tonight - she is one of my good friends from college. Right now 
          she is reading her Sociology notes and eating a cold, frosted, strawberry 
          poptart. I have started calling her Ducky, since she likes all kinds 
          of ducks. I suppose that when she speaks, sometimes it reminds me of 
          Ducky from The Land Before Time cartoon movie. So it all works out. 
          She likes the name, and it is the first time I have given someone a 
          nickname that stuck - I think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, Amy stayed 
          out way too late tonight, and I was going to call her cell phone to 
          make sure she was all right, but it is a little too late now. She was 
          very curt with her roommate about her goings-on, and I bet that if I 
          called, it would be my luck and timing, that she would be doing something 
          that she knows I wouldn't approve of. But who knows. I'll talk to her 
          later.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">It's late now, 
          and I have tomorrow off to take care of my college stuff. So I am going 
          to bed. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I slept in 
          until 2:30 p.m. Why? Because I can. This was my day off, and I went 
          to bed at 4:00 a.m. this morning, so I needed sleep. I woke up though 
          to the sound of my step-sister on the phone - &quot;HA HA HA HA...&quot; 
          she was laughing...loudly. She had already been to school and back by 
          the time I woke up. Huh, that is the latest I have ever slept in...I 
          think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I spent the majority 
          of the day working on this site, trying to acquire the files for a forum, 
          while I don't have my computer here with one already on it. I worked 
          on the new server too, and finally got that working. So it is ready 
          to be transfered, and that is where you are reading this from now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Amy IMed me today. 
          She said that she was in Dallas today with her roommate, Laura. They 
          went to go visit one of her friends that was in Dallas today (for some 
          reason) and then decided to come to Arlington and try to catch me at 
          work. Well, sadly, I wasn't at work. Which was probably a good thing. 
          I do enjoy people coming to see me, but not when I am at work. I like 
          to keep a clean slate when it comes to job performance...I will get 
          on to people if they are standing around talking to their friends while 
          they are supposed to be working, so I can't do it myself, or it has 
          no meaning. But that got me to thinking...and that is all I will say 
          about that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Jay, my good friend 
          from Longview, got his site updated today with my help. It's at www.jaylanier.cc, 
          soon to become IBJay.com. His theme is the same as mine, and I have 
          helped him with his coding, logos, etc. It'll be a neat conglomerate 
          when we have all our people's sites put together. They'll all stem off 
          The-Spot.net, and I will link to them all from here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also talked with 
          John Slaten tonight, of Fujita Scale. He sent me some of his new songs 
          he did. I'll be posting them shortly on my geocities servers so that 
          I don't run out of space on my lycos server. That is my next feature 
          that I will work on after I get done with the Forum.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I talked to Natalie 
          tonight as well, briefly. Things just haven't been going her way lately. 
          A couple days ago she lost her wallet with her credit card, debit card, 
          SS card, DL, cash, etc., and today she told me that she burnt her face 
          when she was tanning...it's not too bad, just little redder than she'd 
          like it to be. Poor girl. She can't drive because she doesn't have her 
          license, so I haven't seen her in about a week and a half. I plan on 
          going to church wednesday night, even if I have to ride a bike. Hopefully 
          my parents will be home to take me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, it's late, 
          again, and I have to go to work at 11:00 tomorrow. So that's all for

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I had my employee 
          meeting this morning. I must say that it was a complete waste of my 
          time. We took a test on proper procedures for ice cream handling, square 
          dipping from the boxes of ice cream, and various other things that were 
          covered in the handbook. Now, it wasn't a real test, but the people 
          next to me kept looking off my paper...THEY are the ones that are supposed 
          to know that stuff, and I'm the new guy. However...the manager did make 
          a comment about me, &quot;If we had 10 more Chris's the we would be 
          in better shape,&quot;&nbsp; and then proceeded to name the other guys, 
          so it wouldn't appear to be favoritism...and then told one girl (the 
          girl with the deathly crush on me) that if we had 4 fewer of her, we 
          would be in better shape too. HAHA...ain't that they truth!</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got all dressed 
          up for the meeting so that I could &quot;mac&quot; while I was there...and 
          it worked. I got looks from the girls it was designed to effect. I figure 
          it won't be long now until we're friends. I'm a slow planner, as you 
          have probably picked up by now, for those of you that know me well enough.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I intended to go 
          to church after that, but my dad had other plans....shopping. Dang. 
          I have about $100 that I need to tithe, and I can't get to church to 
          do it. So, we came home from shopping and I played Tekken, and worked 
          on the site. Then I told my stepsister to bathe herself and lets go 
          do something. In the meantime, I got to talk to two people that are 
          very special to me: Amy and Jamie. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I hadn't talked 
          to Jamie since I left campus, and missed her incredibly. She and I used 
          to talk almost every day, about everything and nothing, as well as meet 
          up for dinner and lunches, when we were available to do so. I think 
          that last semester, Jamie and her friends kept me from seclusion during 
          the beginning of the semester, after I found out that I had been lead 
          on my a girl I was dating. So, it was great talking to her again today, 
          and making her laugh and smile. She wasn't having a very good day, but 
          I always, always try my hardest to make her day better because it is 
          the least I can do since she made everyday wonderful for me. It worked.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After I finished 
          talking to Jamie, we went to look for apartments for my stepsister...not 
          exactly what I had in mind, but it is something. I was extremely bored, 
          and needed to get out of the house, so anything would have been fine. 
          We went through the rich side of Arlingtion, 76011, and there are some 
          AWESOME houses...Mansions, nearly, over there. It was exciting, and 
          I decided that I am going to have a bigger house than that one day. 
          Then we took a trip to Fort Worth. No reason, just wasted gas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We drove around 
          downtown, but there was nothing to see. We then went to Central Market 
          H&middot;E&middot;B. Pretty cool store. We bought some avocados and 
          stuff for making guacamole, and I got one of the highly regarded Jones 
          Sodas, that everyone at etbu drank so frequently. It was Blue Bubble 
          Gum flavor...not too bad.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I cooked some Cajun 
          style shrimp (my own newly developed receipe) for my dinner, and man 
          oh man was it good and spicy! I am a dang good cook. I watched the Simpsons 
          - Homer moved in with two gay guys, hilarious. Afterward, I played Tekken 
          until I came extremely close to cussing out loud at the TV. So I had 
          to stop, or I would have gotten way too upset. And when that happens, 
          I don't feel good.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So I have spent 
          the last 4 hours on the computer, talking to friends, getting frusturated 
          with Kazaa and Windows ME and Dial-up, and working on this site. Thus, 
          now it is time fore bed. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I had to 
          go to work because they scheduled me on the fly yesterday. It was painful. 
          I was tired, and everyone knew it. But my boss was even more tired - 
          he had only gotten 3 hours of sleep last night...so I was doing good 
          with my 6 hours.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I found out that 
          the girls I like are a senior and a junior in high school. Go figure. 
          However, I thought that the younger one was older, and vice versa. Oh 
          well. We hired two new people today, a boy and a lady. So, now I am 
          not the new guy anymore. The girl that has a crush on me didn't bother 
          me too much today...but that may have been only because I worked with 
          her for about an hour and a half.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got off work 
          early (about 15 minutes) and they let me take some ice cream mistakes 
          home. So that was a good thing. My dad and I then went to Pizza Hut, 
          and then to bowl. I didn't beat him not once. He even hurt his thigh, 
          and I still didn't beat him. I am pathetic. I think I was distracted 
          mainly by the music that was playing right above our heads, and by all 
          the girls that were close by.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I played Tekken 
          when I got home, and am having the most difficult time beating the game. 
          I am playing against Lee right now, and he keeps kicking my butt every 
          time...it doesn't matter what other character I use, he spanks them 
          just as hard as the previous one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I planned 
          on talking to Beth tonight, but she wasn't online. Hmm...I guess I will 
          try Monday. I only work two days this week...Tuesday and Thursday. Which 
          means that I can have my friends over on Friday and Saturday. I invited 
          Beth, but if you want to come, call me or email me or something...and 
          let me know...I'm sure it will be all right with my parents. I'll give 
          you my address and you can find a map on maps.yahoo.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I talked to Plato 
          tonight (of the Protractor X). He hasn't been online in a long time. 
          So I caught him up on all the latest happenings with etbustudents.cc 
          and the-spot.net. I don't really have much more to say tonight...so

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I slept in 
          until 10:30...only because I had to do laundry. But I waited until about 
          11 or 12 to do it, so I could have gone back to bed. I watched a little 
          tv, and then went downstairs and fullfilled my cravings for muffins. 
          There is nothing to eat in this house. There are frozen meats, but I 
          don't have my receipes to make big meals from them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I called my mom 
          today and talked to her. I needed my college transcript so that I can 
          apply to TCC in the summer...I also remembered that I have to take another 
          PE and a Theatre Arts class...so that will put me at full time status 
          for the first session, and if I can think of anything else, then it 
          will put me at full time for the second session<strong>. </strong>It 
          was nice to talk to her.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The Dairy Queen 
          in in shambles since I am not there...the person I warned them not to 
          promote has been promoted, and now they are getting what they wanted, 
          but they don't want what they got. This person had no interest in keeping 
          the store running efficiently, cleanly, or professionally...she just 
          wanted the promotion because &quot;Dog-Gonnit, she'd been there the 
          longest, and ain't no kid gonna be tellin her how to do her job!&quot; 
          Well...there ya go, lady. She can deal with all the headaches that every 
          employee brings to their shift, as well as all the meanial tasks they 
          just couldn't quite think all the way through themselves.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Speaking of which, 
          at work yesterday, I fixed a problem that the employees had been complaining 
          about for who knows how long. The drain under the drive through soda 
          fountain kept leaking...the reason (which was plain to see for anyone 
          that would get on their hands and knees and look) was because one of 
          the drain pipes was draining onto the edge of the main pipe, and thus 
          it was running onton the floor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">While I am on the 
          subject of work...I had to work with the girl that has/had a crush on 
          me. I tried my best to just do my work...but she was persistent. &quot;Aww 
          that's so cute...&quot; was her response to everything I did...get frusturated, 
          make an order, cook a burger, sweep the floor, take out the trash, or 
          even tell her what she needed to be doing, instead of nothing. Ugh...kinda 
          sickening to be liked by someone that I can't recipricate the feeling 
          to. I did, however, talk a little more to one of the other girls that 
          I would prefer liked me. But that was all I did, make passing comedic 
          comments. And, I must add also that I have become more jovial with the 
          entire crew there...at least the ones that I have worked with these 
          past couple days...and I think that I am starting to take the place 
          of that of a leader. The other employees keep asking me questions and 
          if I have the keys to something, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I have 
          been added to the schedule for tomorrow morning, at 9:30...sheesh. At 
          least it is more money. I made a strong point tonight when I had to 
          take a mandatory break because I worked more than 6 hours. I told them 
          that I didn't want to take a break, and that I come up here to work, 
          not to take a break. I have nothing to do when I am on break, except 
          waste my time. And to me, my time there is worth money...$8.00 an hour 
          to be exact. I have to admit one thing about DQ...although they weren't 
          the most professional of companies, they paid me for the time I had 
          to spend up there. Oh, I also have a employee meeting on Sunday morning 
          at 9:00. That will be interesting, since it will be the first time I 
          will have worked on Sunday in my entire working career. *frown*</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tomorrow after 
          work, my dad and I are going to do something, but I don't know what. 
          I have invited Natalie, but she didn't return my IM before she logged 
          off...perhaps she got automatically disconnected. But I only invited 
          her for two reasons...1.) she's my friend, and I don't have many of 
          those in this town yet...and 2.) because she IMed me with a &quot;hey, 
          long time no talk, etc...&quot; so I figured she might want to go do 
          something (she likes to bowl). It would be interesting thought, because 
          my dad likes to bowl, and I like to try to beat him, and give him a 
          little competition when he does things, since I know that my stepmom 
          and stepsister aren't much in the way of competition.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, it is time 
          for bed now...it's late. I'm gonna pop online and maybe Amy will be 
          on so I can talk briefly to her. Nope, no Amy...*sigh* Darn. Laterz.</font></p>

          So that poses the problem of her liking the &quot;appearence of me&quot; 
          and not &quot;me.&quot; I work with her tomorrow night, so we will see 
          how it goes. However, I don't find her all that attractive. I have nothing

          my race - I just don't find non-white people attractive too often. (She

          would have been no problem for me to roll over and go back to sleep 
          until 4:00 when it was time for work...except for the fact that I thought 
          I heard the phone ringing. Ugh...it was just the song that I was listening 
          to on my radio. But since I had to get up to go to my step-sister's 
          room to get the phone...I might as well just get up and get dressed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After I got ready 
          and ate some lunch, I did some laundry and got on the internet to get 
          some info about TCC. Then I took a bike ride to the campus, and talked 
          to them...no news there. I am going to have to get my financial info 
          and college transcript from Hubbard before I can even begin to apply 
          for admission. When I go to summer school, it is going to be M-Th every 
          week in the mornings for the classes that I need...and I will have to 
          go to both summer sessions to get them all...that will prevent me from

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I took a tour of 
          the school...and it reminded me a great deal of Lamar University in 
          Beaumont, TX...although it was much smaller. I did see some pretty people....and 
          some ugly ones. ButI didn't bother myself with asserting any friendly 
          gestures...although I probably would have done well to do so.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Have I mentioned 
          yet how much I love going to work? Good, because I don't. Well, I didn't 
          until tonight. Before I left, I really just wanted to go back home and 
          take a nap. But when I got there, and as time went on, I found things 
          to do. I promoted myself to Crew Leader (Shift Leader in DQ terms...here, 
          it is basically a glorified regular employee, that makes sure everyone 
          does their stuff.) since that is what I was hired on to be anyway. I 
          am curious though as to when I am actually going to become the assistant

        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got to make the 
          ice cream for the customers at the counter...you know, from the long 
          cabinet of various flavors of ice cream. Anyway, that was interesting...however, 
          there was the common problem of us running out of items in the store. 
          We just got our truck in yesterday, and we are already out of a number 
          of things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I closed tonight, 
          and was assigned to Lobby Duty. Basically I had to sweep, mop, and take 
          out the trash in the lobby. Not a big deal at all...or so I thought. 
          This store is nearly twice the size, if not a little more, than the 
          Hubbard DQ. It took me a good 15-20 minutes to sweep the lobby floor.

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today was my second 
          day at work. It was considerably more interesting than the first one. 
          Today I learned how to make most of the ice cream products that we serve. 
          The other empolyees above me often shouted to me that they needed a 
          certain thing, and expected me to just know how to make it. Oh well...One 
          of the other things I did today was the dirty work. I had to take out 
          the trash (6 big garbage cans, and a bunch of boxes) that they don't 
          take out at night, because they don't open the back door after it is 
          dark. They could still take the trash out to the dumpster as they are 
          leaving at the end of the night. Hmm...I also did a little cooking. 
          It surprised them to see me get the food out in under 5 minutes. But 
          it is not that hard. I really don't see why they can't make their time 
          limits for getting orders out, except that they are not as organized 
          as they need to be.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">A cute girl came 
          into work today (cute by the other empolyee's standards) and Tasha, 
          one of the Crew Managers asked why don't I go up and talk to this girl...well, 
          ya know...I'm not that forward. If a girl wants to date me bad enough, 
          she will talk to me...but, if she doesn't talk to me, she will show 
          something of interest so that we would have reason to talk. Anyway, 
          Tasha has taken it upon herself to &quot;hook me up.&quot; MAN, I wonder 
          what that means...she's a black girl, 20 yrs old...and I am curious 
          as to what she is going to hook me up to...? I also found out that there 
          is yet another girl that I work with, that doesn't look too bad either...however, 
          I believe she is in high school as well....and she doesn't talk much. 
          But then again, neither do I while I am there. For some reason, it feels 
          like I am visiting their store, and these people are not the people 
          that I am supposed to be with. Hmm...I guess that just goes right along 
          with the fact that the wind is always blowing against me when I am riding 
          to work....I should have taken the Arby's job.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I met AJ, the guy 
          that hired me, per Deborah, the District Manager or something higher. 
          He seemed nice enough, although I had other things on my mind, like 
          &quot;I have to fill that order in the kitchen, so I can't stay and 
          chat.&quot; Oh well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, they let 
          me off early today, so I came home and played some Tekken. I am still 
          on the same game sequence that I have been on since I got home. It is 
          tough tonight. My dad came in after dinner or something and played too. 
          He kinda got into the game, calling the characters names, and developing 
          a vendeta toward the computerized opponent. He had fun though.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After that we played 
          a game of Hand 'n Foot. I was second for a majority of the game, but 
          in the end I was bumped down to last place. Oh well. I am pretty sleepy 
          now...so I guess that is all for tonight. Laterz.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I did absolutly 
          nothing constructive. Well, that is not entirely accurate...but I didn't 
          do much. I got up this morning and decided to go to Wal*Mart to see 
          if they had anything that Nix and Will could play with...but after one 
          game of Tekken.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Yeah, that one 
          game...it didn't turn out to be one game. I played until I beat the 
          game twice...not stoping for lunch, but however, stopping to see if 
          I could get some combination codes off the internet. No luck there. 
          So, I kept playing, and about that time, my stepsister came home. So 
          she played some too. Once again, she got spanked. I had been playing 
          all day, with different characters, and had pretty much figured out 
          a majority of the combinations for each.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So we broke for 
          lunch at about 3:00, and she started her homework. After a while of 
          that, we went to Wal*Mart to shop around. I ended up getting a new, 
          bigger tank for Nix and Will, as well as a cave-rock, and more gravel. 
          We went to Petsmart and the Dollar Tree as well while we were out. I 
          ended up spending $20 today, and she spent about $55. Oh well. Now I 
          am broke again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So now that I have 
          two aquariums, I think I am going to buy another regular crab from Petsmart 
          to put in it. I will need to set aside enough money though for a palm 
          piolet. I hadn't planned on getting these crabs when I decided I would 
          get a palm piolet.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we got back, 
          I set up the tank and made one end deaper than the other...that is so 
          that they can have water in the bottom of the cage to play in and drink. 
          Well...Nix didn't feel like being social today, and I don't guess Will 
          did either, but he is the one that we played with today. He was sitting 
          here with me while I wrote this, but he kept wandering off into the 
          dark spots of the room, so I put him away. I am concerned though because 
          I haven't seen them eat since I got them. But I guess they will be all 
          right...I hope.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My stepsister and 
          I played more on the playstation until the parents got home, and she 
          started off kicking my but in Tekken. I was a little upset...but then 
          I started eating some Pringles, and came back to beat her 18 times. 
          Needless to say, she soon got tired of playing, and left.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got in the hot 
          tub tonight, and read a little of my Products Manual for Braum's. It's 
          pretty boring, and I already know how to make most of the stuff, but 
          I have to read it to do it properly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I am about 
          done tonight...I am talking to Amy (just thought I would stick your 
          name in here for ya to see online :-).) Laterz.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today was church 
          day. So my dad and I went to Natalie's church. (However, it is not &quot;Natalie's 
          church&quot;...but merely the church that she goes to on Sunday and 
          Wednesday nights) Anyway, he thought the songs were too traditional, 
          but I thought that, eventhough they were traditional, I knew the words, 
          and that is ok by me. He liked the preaching though, so that's good.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After church, I 
          went to the mall, and had $50.00 in my pocket. I did pretty good for 
          the majority of the time there...but in the end I had a craving for 
          some strawberries. So I bought 2 smoothies...one from Sonic, and one 
          from Frullati. Those were the best dang smoothies I have had in a while.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I walked around 
          the mall, in search for parts for my computer (which I still don't have 
          here yet...although I am going to try to get it Friday), but I didn't 
          find any that met my needs. And I didn't want to spend money on a video 
          game that I would beat in a few weeks, and get tired of, since I don't 
          play video games much anyway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Right before we 
          left, I remembered that they had a booth in the mall that sold Hermit 
          Crabs with decorated shells. So I stopped by and got two for $25 (plus 
          the tank, food, sand, a sponge, eating dish, and instructions). One 
          of them has a blue shell, so I named it Nix (after my friend Benji's 
          friend...I wanted a funky name for it, and that is about as crazy as 
          names get...unless you start going multicultrual...but I won't go there). 
          The other one had beads glued onto its shell, so my stepmom named it 
          Wilbure...personally, I don't like that name...it is not a crab name, 
          so I have changed it to Will. Nix and Will. They're fun...I think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, while I 
          was browsing the mall, I was asked 5 times by various people in various 
          departments how to find something. The first time I was in Kay-Bee toy 
          store, looking at video games, and a little girl came up to me and asked 
          if we had Gameboy Advance SP. (How should I know?) &quot;Um, I don't 
          work here..ask them.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The second time 
          I was in Game Stop with my step sister...and a black dude came up to 
          me, pointed to a poster, and asked if that was on sale. &quot;Sorry, 
          man...I don't work here.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The third, fourth, 
          and fifth times, three different kids at the crab stand asked how much 
          they are, can we touch them, and again how much they cost. &quot;I don't 
          work here...as him&quot;...&quot;I don't work here...ask him&quot;...&quot;I 
          don't work here...but there is the sign with all the prices.&quot; Ugh, 
          it was upsetting and kinda wierd.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My dad, stepmom, 
          and I went back to church tonight, and they finally got to meet Natalie. 
          There wasn't much conversation exchanged, but it was just to put a face 
          to a name in my stories. She and Charlie had something - anything - 
          planned tonight, so I didn't hang out with that group tonight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Instead, my stepsister 
          and I spent some qualite time together. She bought Tekken 1 and Army 
          Men 3DO for her Playstation this afternoon at the mall. So she and I 
          played it for a good majority of the night. I kicked her butt in Tekken, 
          and we were both disappointed about the army man game. And shortly after 
          we got started on the Playstation, I developed a blister on my thumb 
          from punching the buttons too hard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">About 11:00 we 
          quit, and she went to bed. However, I kept on going with Tekken, and 
          as soon as she walked out of the room, I beat the game. So, I then tried 
          to do it again, and it took about 1:15 hours, with the final guy taking 
          30 minutes alone. (The first time I beat it, it only took 8 minutes 
          to beat the last dude) So, that game has worn off it's affect. The sucky 
          part about it is that I can't unlock any of the other characters. I 
          thought that I would be able to play with them if I played them in the 
          Arcade version. Dah well...if someone out there knows how to unlock 
          the characters on playstation, let me know please. Thanks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I suppose

          was my first day at work. I work for Braum's...just like Dairy Queen, 
          only with real ice cream and a grocery store. But I didn't go in until 
          3:00. Before then, I had to go to the post office to pick up a package 
          that was forwarded to me. Apparently the post office from Hubbard made 
          me pay the postage for forwarding my mail. That stinks - $3.53 gone, 
          on insurance information that is not even valid because I don't live 
          in Central Texas anymore. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">But 
          I got to drive the Blazer to the post office and around Arlington. We 
          went to Natalie's house to see if she was home before I called, but 
          she wasn't. I kinda figured that she would be working on Saturday, since 
          it would be one of the days she is not in school. I also drove by my 
          old house on Marshalldale St. They painted the trim and highlights of 
          the house a tanish brown color - which doesn't really match, but neither 
          did the baby blue that was there before it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, 
          at work today, I was in for more than I bargained for. As soon as I 
          clocked in, the thought ran through my head...&quot;I don't know what 
          I am doing here...I should have gone with Arby's.&quot; But I stuck 
          it out, and it got better as the night went by. Now, I don't know if 
          it was because we were running out of things, or what, but the empolyees 
          there are not too concerned with making sure the store is cleaned during 
          the day. I don't think I saw anyone go out into the dining room to clean 
          it or sweep it during the night.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When 
          I got there, the first thing I did constructive was grab a rag and start 
          wiping things down. They didn't train me very well, from the standpoint 
          of a Dairy Queen manager. In fact, I had to initiate my training myself. 
          For the first 3 or 4 hours, I cleaned behind the counter, and the dining 
          room. It was a mess...and it just got messier as the night went on. 
          I guess that this type of ice cream preparation makes for a bigger mess 
          than soft-serve does. But also there was the fact that there are about 
          9-10 people on a shift, where as at Dairy Queen there are 2-3 people.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">For 
          the majority of the night, we were packed with customers...as if it 
          were dinner time all night long at DQ. We are, for the most part, required 
          to take a 30 minute break after 4 hours. I would usually prefer to work 
          through my break because we have to clock out to take it. I need money, 
          and if I wanted to not get paid for going to Braum's, then I would have 
          not gotten a job there. But I only took about 15 minutes of my break 
          tonight.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Once 
          I realized that cleaning was a lost cause, I told my manager that I 
          needed something to do. I couldn't ring on registers because they were 
          assigned to the other people on the shift already. So I got to do what 
          I liked to do best...cook. It took a while to get used to the computer 
          screen orders that they have setup there. And then it took another while 
          to get used to what all the burgers are made with. But for about the 
          last hour, I had the kitchen to myself, while my trainer did dishes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Now, 
          I did notice these two girls that worked with me tonight. One of them 
          in particular kept stealing glances at me. So when I happened to meet 
          her eyes, I looked at what she was doing to find out why she was looking 
          at me. Usually she was mixing a shake, or walking over to the ice cream 
          to start to scoop it (I was standing on the other side). So I don't 
          really think anything of it. However, I do have to be prepared to react 
          if something should come up.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, 
          I was started as a Crew Manager in training. A Crew Manager, is nothing 
          more than a glorified regular employee. I don't get keys to the store, 
          or codes for getting change, or anything important...however, I also 
          don't have to empty the grease trap, or do the dishes often, or any 
          of the other grunge jobs. But, I do them anyway. I am used to doing 
          them, and to me, if I don't do them or have someone that I know knows 
          how to do them, then I don't think that they were done right.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          managed to get Sunday and Monday off...and then Saturday, Sunday, and 
          next Monday off as well. So if I could just get every Sunday off that 
          would be great. I would like to get just Sunday and Wednesday night 
          off...and work the rest of the days of the week, but I don't think he 
          is going to go for that.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, 
          tonight is Day Light Savings time...so I have to set my clocks ahead 
          1 hour. It's not 1:21 a.m. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Man 
          was I tired this morning! I went to bed about 12:30 last night, and 
          got up at 7:45 this morning, but I could have just as easily rolled 
          over and not thought twice about getting out of bed. After I was done 
          getting ready, my grandmother and I went to Walmart and did our shopping 
          for the things we needed to cook at the Luau. It took us an hour to 
          do just the shopping, surprisingly.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We 
          made a stop back by her house, and then she let me drive her van from 
          there to the church. I did pretty well. Things are different because 
          it is a van and because it is kinda old. But we got started&nbsp; right 
          after that.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We 
          started with the desert, which had to chill for 4 hours before being 
          served. It was a graham cracker crust type deal, with a pudding/mouse 
          filling mixed with pineapple and coconut, garnished with strawberries 
          and a kiwi slice. Then we working on the fruit salad made of watermelon, 
          honeydew, grapes, and pineapple. I hate making melon balls now. It is 
          the most tedious job I have done.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Next 
          was the chicken breasts. We sliced up some bellpepers, onions, and pineapple...and 
          mixed that in with some breaded and browned chicken breasts, and baked 
          it. When it was done we sprinkled almonds, and the juice from the frying 
          of the chicken. It tasted pretty good, eventhough I thought it wouldn't. 
          We also had some green beans seasoned with some Mrs. Dash of some sort, 
          and butter...as well as a dish of rice, navy beans, peas, and carrots. 
          Of course, there was also a side dish of salad with some homemade ranch 
          dressing.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We 
          served it to the people, and this was nearly one of the most unfriendly 
          group of people I have served. They didn't say too much to me, but they 
          didn't move out of my way when I had a hot pan or heavy dish either. 
          I suppose it is because my patience was worn thin by that time anyway. 
          (When I cook, I am used to fast cooking, not having all day to do things....so 
          if I am going to cook a meal, I don't plan on having an hour to do it 
          in, I want to get everything done asap and one thing right after the 
          other.)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So 
          tonight I am pretty tired. I have been on my feet for 15 hours straight, 
          and am about ready to hit the sack. So good night and I'll catch ya

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">OK...so 
          my first interview with Arby's was pretty good. I didn't really want 
          to go to any of the other interviews after that one. The District Manager 
          resembled Chris Rock, and he and I got along really well. However, I 
          had to check out the other two options I had to see which one would 
          be best for me.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Braum's 
          was next. It is a 30 minute bike ride, up hill both ways, and into the 
          wind. The only reason that I would take their job is because they are 
          offering me $8.00/hr, which is what I was making at DQ as an Assistant 
          Manager. I need the money, and that is afterall what I am doing this 
          for. I had the interview, and immediately after we finished talking 
          the manager went and got the paperwork for me to fill out. So I did, 
          but I had to let him know that I still had one more interview that afternoon. 
          The store needs a major clean up, and the people there need someone 
          to be on their butt about speed of service. But I am entirely capable 
          of assuming that role.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          then did the interview with Starbucks. I realized a number of times 
          that I don't know anything about coffee. Nothing. I didn't really even 
          expect them to look at my application because they said they weren't 
          hiring. Also, they are in Grand Prarie. I can't ride my bike to Grand 
          Prarie every day...or even every other day. So needless to say, I don't 
          think I will be taking this job.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          tried to call my grandmother tonight to get out of going to help her 
          with the catering deal she has to do at the church tomorrow, so that 
          I could try to start my job tomorrow, instead. But, she insisted that 
          I help her and take care of my business over the phone from her church. 
          So, I guess I will. We went out to eat, and then we went to drop me 
          off that the rental house they are working on. From there, we went to 
          Grandbury and I'll spend the night so that I can get up tomorrow morning. 
          This is the part where I go to sleep. Laterz.</font></p>

          I wake up this morning to a phone call. Arby's wants to set up an interview 
          tomorrow at 8:30. Now I have one for Arby's and one for Starbucks. A 
          couple hours later Braum's calls to set up their interview at 11:00.

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today, 
          I spent the majority of my day by the phone so that I could receive 
          those calls. While I did that, I borrowed the code for a calendar from 
          etbu's register.etbu.edu webpage, and put it on to my front page for 
          The-Spot.net. From there, I decided that I could just finish up part 
          of the page and post it to the internet, so that when people go to etbuers.com, 
          they have more to look at than just the journal...although it is not 
          much more. I haven't quite decided on a design for it yet, but I have 
          found the proper color of blue that I want to use. I think that I will 
          work with a better design and background/theme. I don't know...now that 
          I am going to have a job after tomorrow, I don't know where I will find 
          the time.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          went to open my bank account today, and now I have free online banking...and 
          am going to get a check card, as well as a book of checks...it is not 
          the same deal as I had at my old bank. I have to pay for the checks 
          here...but it should be ok. I also wanted to get a copy of Microsoft 
          Money or Quickbooks, but we don't have a CD like I thought we had. Oh 
          well...I know how to use Microsoft Excel efficiently enough to make 
          my own check register and budget.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          also got a call from Natalie today. She and I went out to dinner...her 
          brother was supposed to come, but he had somethings to take care of. 
          So it was just the two of us. It was nice. I believe that it was the 
          first thing that we have ever done where it was just the two of us. 
          However, the restaurant we went to wasn't all that great. The taste 
          of the food was decent, but the quantity and the quality was not so 
          great. Their french fries were 1/4&quot; thick (skinnier than McDonald's) 
          and their burgers were smaller than Dairy Queen's smallest burger. But 
          it was only $12.00 so I picked up the bill (hey, it was the proper thing 
          to do, right? Well, I think so...) Afterward we went to church. One 
          of the other youth group guys did a lesson tonight. He did pretty well, 
          and got some feedback from the class. Then she, Charile, Greg (her brother) 
          and I went fishing. We didn't catch anything, but I fished just to humor 
          myself. I just sat there and enjoyed the breeze and the semi-country 
          air. Natalie and I talked briefly, and then Charlie came over and then 
          Greg. Shortly after, we went back to her house, and Charlie played Zelda 
          on GameCube...and I talked to a couple people online. It was a pretty 
          simple night.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Six 
          o'clock, my alarm sounds...dang it, why did I do this this morning? 
          Oh, yeah...I need a job. Six-thirty, I'm heading out the door. It is 
          near 50 degrees out, and windy, and I am hungry. I make it to the high 
          school nearby, and wonder &quot;ok, if I am going to turn back, now 
          is the time...oh wait, I need a job...but can I get one somewhere else 
          that won't require me to ride so far? Probably not...keep going, you'll 
          make it...you have 3 1/2 hours.&quot; Thus, I press on.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Now, 
          my instructions tell me to take I-20...I'm on a bike, that is not a 
          good idea. So, I take the urban route. To make a long story short, I 
          have a bumpy ride, it's windy, I'm cold and thirsty, and I get there 
          in a whole lot less time than I had planned for. So I stop in at a dentist 
          office and change my shirt there, and get ready for the job fair. Now 
          I have 2 hours to sit and wait at Braum's. I didn't get the first interview, 
          because I was busy reading the Business Section of the newspaper. However, 
          I did get an interview, and it showed the lady that I had dedication 
          to ride my bike 1 1/2 hours to get a job interview, plus the fact that 
          DQ was going to make me a manager, and also that I had only missed one 
          day out of 3 years because I was sick. So she saw that I was dedicated 
          and determined to get and keep a job.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">On 
          the way back home, I took a slightly longer route, so that I could time 
          how long it would take for me to get from my new workplace (Braum's 
          on Green Oaks and Matlock). From my calculations it is a 20-30 minute 
          ride there and the same back.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Once 
          I got back home, I ate lunch and played with Lucy (the dog). I wish 
          she were a cat...all I wanted her to do was rest on the couch with me 
          while I watched TV...but she wanted me to pet her and feed her my wheat 
          thins. After lunch, I got online for a little bit, and much to my surprise, 
          Amy was online. I hadn't talked to Amy since Christmas Eve...when I 
          called her unexpectedly. She never did call back...dah well. I also 
          wrote her a letter, but she never got it...it came back in March some 
          time. She seemed pretty happy today...I guess because she broke up with 
          her boyfriend recently. It was great to talk to her, and hopefully we 
          will talk more often.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After 
          that, I took a nap, and when I woke up, my parents had already gotten 
          home, so I told them of my day. I also got a call from Starbucks to 
          get an interview with them tomorrow at 3:00. I don't really know anything 
          about coffee, but I can serve food, fast.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          had hot-links for dinner, however they weren't very hot...some type 
          of off brand. I also had a cardboard pizza...and it was all right. I 
          watched a little bit of Conspiracy Theory, and then played Age of Empires 
          - The Conquerors. Now I am online, and tried to work on my home page 
          for The Spot...but I am finding it increasingly harder to create the 
          kind of webpage that I want using software that I don't know how to 
          use all that well. I am using Dreamweaver and Fireworks...but I don't 
          know how to make a webpage in either one of them very well. I am lucky 
          to get this journal the way it is in Dreamweaver.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway,

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, 
          my dad had to work from home this morning. That was interesting in and 
          of itself. He held a phone confrence with the people in the confrence 
          room. I heard a good deal of what they were talking about, but it didn't 
          make much sense to me, other than the denotatio of the words. I was 
          surprised to see that my dad has &quot;people&quot; and is the head 
          of a disaster recovery team at his company.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          made a list of things to do this morning, and started out with the first 
          one: laundry. That went well, for the first load. Then I got sidetracked 
          by filling out applications, and figuring out what I needed to do about 
          this weekend and getting my stuff from Hubbard, and closing my bank 
          account there. I also have a birthday party to go to this weekend. Fortunately 
          I got permission to go to it instead of to a Great Uncle and Aunt's 
          house that I don't know. Whew!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          ate a late lunch and then went on my way to Great Southwest Parkway 
          to apply for more jobs. I went to the Arby's, Sonic, Burger King, Best 
          Western Inn...all were &quot;accepting applications,&quot; but no one 
          was &quot;hiring.&quot; Ugh...so I stopped by AT&amp;T Wireless before 
          I came home. And there is an interesting story that goes along with 
          this stop...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          arrived at the store, and there were 3 other people in front of me in 
          line. So I looked around at the phones because there was no one else 
          that had come in after me. I did find some cheap pre-paid phones...and 
          a palm-piolet. But by the time I looked at all the phones, the first 
          person in line was almost done being helped. So, I got in line, and 
          shortly after that a hispanic/white lady came in and went to right in 
          front of me at the counter. I guess she didn't see that there was a 
          line with 4 people in it. But the lady that was behind the counter didn't 
          seem to mind that she cut in line, and went from the first person to 
          this lady. Now, the other two people in front of me didn't say anything, 
          but I could tell that they were a little disturbed about not being waited 
          on in line.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, 
          this lady took 30-40 minutes to get her sh** taken care of, and kept 
          asking about her two account bills, thinking they were one account and 
          that she was being over charged; asking which phone was the cheapest 
          - (that one, no..that one, over there...the one on the left, yeah...no, 
          the other one...the Nokia with the Orange face plate, yeah); could she 
          pay her bill there; telling her bratty kid with a slingshot to stop 
          snapping people on the butt with it, and stop wandering around the store, 
          and to come out from behind the counter, and to quite making noises 
          with his mouth; can she change her address now; can she change her phone 
          number on her phone now; is there a 972 area code available, no nevermind, 
          I'll just keep the 214; again, which phone is the cheapest?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">*sigh* 
          THEN she got to the people in the line. By this time there were two 
          other people that came in. Totaling 6 customers, and only one service 
          person. All I wanted was a stinkin' application for employment...it 
          was very visible that she needed help. So she helped the first guy, 
          then the second guy, who also asked &quot;Can I pay my bill here?&quot; 
          NO, YOU CAN'T! Did you not here the stupid lady that cut in line? She 
          asked it twice! You can pay it online, or mail it in, and it takes 10 
          days.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Then 
          it was finally my turn. &quot;Can I get an application for employment?&quot;...no, 
          I'm sorry, we don't hire here...you can go to out website, and apply, 
          and post your resume online, and then they will contact you if you meet 
          their qualifications. <strong>Son of a </strong>#*<em>Mother*</em>#! 
          I waited for 45 minutes to get that answer...thanks, woman. So I left.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          came home, rested, and then we went out to eat at a Mexican Food restaurant. 
          It was pretty good, but I wouldn't have gotten full, if I hadn't eaten 
          a basket of chips and the rest of my dad's food. Afterward, we went 
          for a walk around the block, and walked the dog. That walk seemed extremely 
          short compared to the walks that I usually go on. The parents were talking 
          about how they are sore, and need to start getting back. *sigh...they 
          need some more exercise*</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Later 
          we got in the hot-tub, which was quite fun. I hadn't been in a hot-tub 
          for about 10 years or so. I found out that I can use it when ever I 
          want, which is a good thing. Afterward, we played Hand 'n Foot, and 
          I went out all but once (out of four times) and came in second place. 
          I was excited.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          got on www.careerbuilder.com tonight and looked for jobs. Almost every 
          one of them had some kind of education requirement, or a certain length 
          of work experience. On the last page that I was going to look at before 
          I went to bed, I found a Job Fair for Braum's. It was tomorrow April 
          1st, at 10:00-3:00! And it was on the other side of Arlington! *dang!...I 
          think I can do it though...if I go to bed right now* So I am setting 
          my alram for 6:00, and plan to leave by 6:30. That's all for tonight.

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">There 
          was a slight change of plans shortly after I posted my journal last 
          night. Natalie told me that she only goes to the evening service of 
          her church (no matter how hard I pleaded...without being a jerk...she 
          wouldn't conceed and go to a morning service). So I went to my parents' 
          church. It was all right, I suppose. I didn't like the songs much because 
          they were unfamiliar. However, the preaching was energetic, and the 
          music was contemporary as well. The people were nice - those that my 
          dad knew, at least. We had to go through the whole schpeel about how 
          &quot;I had just moved in last week, and that is the reason they weren't 
          there at church, and where my stepmom was, and how I have liked it...yada 
          yada yada.&quot; It was tiring.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, 
          my dad and I went to go to find jobs around Grand Prarie. I applied 
          at Starbucks, though I know nothing about coffee; Verizon Wireless, 
          although they only accept applications on weekdays, and I have to have 
          a resume' accompanying my application; The Home Depot, even though I 
          know very very little about home improvement; and also to Target, where 
          I had to take 40 minutes to fill out an application on one of the slowest 
          computers I have ever remembered working on.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We 
          then went to the grocery store and got the ingredients for spaghetti. 
          I was pretty hungry this afternoon, so I was a little disappointed when 
          we didn't start lunch as soon as we got home. Instead we watched a little 
          bit of a movie on Lifetime. So, I took some initiative, and made the 
          family lunch. I cooked the noodles, sauce, bread, and salad while they 
          watched their movie. It was a pretty good meal, although I would have 
          preferred that they didn't mix the noodles with the sauce before serving 
          it. Dah well....</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Once 
          lunch was over, I helped my dad with some yard work. Not to be rude 
          or nothing, it really needed it in the backyard. We also got the hot-tub 
          chemicals and got that working too. By the time it was all over, it 
          was near time for Natalie to come pick me up for church tonight.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">About 
          6:00, she pulled up and we were off. Church was more traditional over 
          there. We sang our songs, heard the sermon, and then had a fellowship. 
          It was a Mexican food type deal with tacos, and burritos. We also played 
          a game where you have to collect as many signatures as you can based 
          on who has done what in their lifetime. I had just finished my sheet, 
          right after he collected the third one. There was no prize for 4th place. 
          Dang.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So 
          we sat around for about 30 minutes deciding what to do next. Sound familiar? 
          That is what my friends and I did in college when we were having a night 
          out. We would gather in the lobby after dinner, and discuss what we 
          were going to do for the rest of the night. Usually the discussion lasted 
          until shortly before curfew, when we moved it outside on the porch of 
          the dorm. Usually we would go to Airport Park, or Walmart, or The Waffle 
          House. But here, we decided to go to one of Natalie's friend's house. 
          She had baby chickens that were supposed to be a science expreiment, 
          but she couldn't stand breaking them open before they were supposed 
          to be born (and I must say that I would have a small problem with doing 
          that too...but that is just because I would rather not, and let the 
          animal live.)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">There 
          I saw a girl that I had not seen since Junior High (or maybe even High 
          School). I was surprised that I even remembered her name. Allow me to 
          indulge on how I remembered...I think with colors. Every letter/number/smell/sound/thought 
          is associated with a color in my mind. However, there are cases when 
          I associate physical attributes of people with letters of their name 
          so that I can remember their name. In this case, Kaci...the C resembled 
          the nearly perfect circle that constructs her face from a straight forward 
          view. The K is for the shoulder length dark brown hair. And for some 
          reason, I remembered her.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Once 
          that was all done, we engaged in another conversation of what we wanted 
          to do - resolving to go to Putt-Putt. However, it was only Natalie, 
          her boyfriend, and myself that went. Everyone else wanted to go to bed. 
          This is the most bed-time oriented bunch of teenagers that I have ever 
          seen! it could be that they still have curfews because a lot of them 
          are still in High School...but even the older ones try to get in bed 
          by 10:30. To me...it's pretty insane. Although, I would like to go to 
          bed earlier, there is stuff that needs to be done, and there are certain 
          times that it can be done. Hanging out with this group of friends is 
          a day- and time-oriented event. So I put bedtime off until I am either 
          done, or have reached my 12:00 curfew.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight 
          the Putt-Putt master was Natalie. I was nearly 7 strokes over par, and 
          Charile (her boyfriend) was about 4. Mine was due to a couple 5-stroke 
          limit holes. *frown* We should have played pool. But we also did the 
          batting cages. I hit about half the balls...out of two tokens, so I 
          basically hit $1's worth. Natalie did the same, and I don't know how 
          many Charlie did. It was an interesting night, and a perfectly good 
          waste of $6. Now I am down to about $3.00 on hand.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I'm 
          online now, and wondering if anyone that I know (that want's to talk 
          to me) is going to come on too. So that's all for tonight. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This 
          morning I awoke to the smell of sausage and eggs. But I only made it 
          halfway downstairs before I subconsciously realized that there was none 
          left. Dah well...I decided to take my shower and then go downstairs 
          to get something to eat. So, I made my first batch of blueberry muffins. 
          GOOD STUFF! I must say, they didn't rise as much as I anticipated, but 
          they tasted pretty good. So I watched the History Channel with my dad, 
          about submarines and at my muffins.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, 
          I had nothing better to do, so I played Age of Empires briefly. I discovered 
          a monkey man on there that can destroy most buildings and people with 
          one hit. It wasn't much fun causing the 7 other opponents to resign 
          because three monkeys raided their village...but it was kinda funny.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Toward 
          the end of the game, my dad called me downstairs to start my driver's 
          training. He and my stepmom want me to learn to drive a stick-shift. 
          Now, I am confident that I have the timing down-pat for shifting while 
          driving. However, when we got out to the parking lot of an abandoned 
          store, I didn't realize that there was sooo much complication to actually 
          getting the car to move.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After 
          I finally got it going, the next step was stopping it and getting it 
          going again. BIG MISTAKE. I couldn't quite get the car to move at all, 
          much less without making it jerk extensively. After about 20 tries, 
          the Check Engine light came on, and wouldn't go off. So, it is off to 
          the Ford Dealership to get it fixed. They said they would have it done 
          on Monday sometime.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, 
          we spent the rest of the day bopping around Arlington, getting applications 
          from near-by stores, shopping, and going to Pizza Hut. I got some new 
          shoes, and a bike helmet. Hehe, I went to a tanning place just to see 
          if I could get a job there but their &quot;positions were all filled.&quot; 
          Dang, I would have liked to work with those girls. ;-) Dah well...I'll 
          check back some other time.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          have been looking into getting a Palm Piolet lately, but I have to get 
          a job first to be able to afford something like that. And I have also 
          been looking into getting a cell phone, which would also require me 
          to get a job. However, I am pretty confident that if I can get my car 
          paid off within the next payment, then I will be able to get either 
          one of those gadgets relatively quickly.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When 
          we got home from shopping, we were all pretty tired. So my family and 
          I lounged around and watched The Rock on USA. Then we played Hand 'n 
          Foot. It's a fun family card game. The rules are tricky and could probably 
          be best described by their website...which could be found on yahoo.com 
          most likely. I have yet to show them how to Farkle though. I think they 
          might like that too...once they get tired of their card game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I 
          plan to go to Natalie's church tomorrow. I don't have much to say on 
          this subject though. It will be curious to see how everything goes, 
          as far as Sunday School teaching, the sermon, and acceptance in general. 
          I'll keep ya updated as more news breaks. ;-)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Yesterday, 
          after I ended my journal, I came up with a number of Top 5 lists for 
          Benji Deptula to use on his journal. So, I then realized that I could 
          very well have a Top 5 list on my journal...but so as not to copy him, 
          I think I will have a Top 6, and this week's is listed below. That's

        <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana"><font size="3">Well, 
          today was pretty simple. I got up and attempted to cut my hair, but 
          I wasn't quite awake enough. So I decided to play Age of Empires while 
          I woke up.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Around noon, I 
          had finished my game, victorious, with a score 5 times higher than the 
          opponenets on the game. Then I cut my hair. I didn't mess up this time, 
          thankfully. However it would look much better if I had my bangs grown 
          out longer. That will take about two weeks or so.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I met some of my 
          stepsister's friends today, when they took my by Eckard's to put in 
          an application. I must say that I don't really approve of them, but 
          then again, I only <em>saw</em> them, and didn't meet with them. It 
          would take some time before I could give an accurate approval.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, my dad, stepmom, 
          and I went out to eat tonight at Spring Creek BBQ. The meat was good, 
          but there wasn't much else that appealed. I was hopping for an all-you-can-eat 
          deal with the meat, but it was only for the vegetables and the bread. 
          Afterward, we went bowling. Fun stuff. The first game, my dad won. He's 
          pretty good at bowling, and has been doing it for a while. The next 
          game, I figured out how the ball needed to be thrown and how the lane 
          curves. Needless to say, I won that game. So, we played another, and 
          he won. Then another, and I won. Now the score was two-two, so we had 
          to play another game. It was tied all the way up until I threw three 
          gutterballs in a row. At that point, he threw the rest of the frames 
          with a spare. Five straight frames, in spares. 139-113. He won. He is 
          still better than me, but his day is coming. ;-)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, I watched 
          Deep Impact. It's a pretty good show. But, in the words of a story titled 
          by Benji, et al...&quot;Why can't the bad guys win for once?&quot; I 
          would have liked to see how the human race would have survived through 
          an impact from a comet. <em>That</em> would have made for an interesting 
          movie, and possibly sequels. Oh well, I don't write the movies...although 
          I probably should. ;-)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, that is all 
          for tonight. Hopefully I will be able to keep this thing running daily.
