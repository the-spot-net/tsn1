        <p>I didn't get up today until 1:00. My alarm was set to go off at 1:30, 
          but subconsciously I realized while I was asleep that I needed to have 
          some time to eat before I went to work.</p>
        <p>On the ride to work, I thought about Stacy and our situation the entire 
          time. As most of you know, I am a planner when it comes to relationships. 
          Last night I wrote out a two page letter detailing the reasons that 
          I believe I &quot;love&quot; her. Yeah, I know that I told her that 
          I wouldn't say that to her until the day I asked her to marry my, but 
          I changed my mind. (And now that I have changed it, it works a lot better 
          now). So I considered how I was going to get the letters I wrote to 
          her, and how I was going to call her, tonight, or if I even should since 
          it is afterall a school night, and she has to get up early in the morning. 
          I have just decided that I will call her in the morning, making myself 
          get up early for her to talk to her before she goes to school. That 
          should make her day better.</p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I didn't get to work with 
          her tonight, but she went out with her mom for Mother's day. She did 
          come to see me afterward though, incognito, with one of her friends. 
          That was sweet of her. For some reason, on my way, I kept telling myself, 
          she is going to surprise me today and come see me while I am at work. 
          But I didn't listen to myself and bring the pics and letters. It's ok 
          though. I did get a letter from her when her sister got there...she 
          reached for my hand (Lauren did) and I was curious as to what was going 
          on, but then I felt the paper between our hands. She was passing me 
          the note indiscretly. She had written it while she was at school in 
          Algebra class. She is so sweet. She signed it with &quot;Love Always, 
          Stacy&quot; and placed lots of X's and O's all over the place, and in 
          big letters. I am glad to see that she is sticking up for us, while 
          she is at home and her sister is ragging on her about us. She's a fighter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work, I got to run the 
          show tonight, and we had some people that actually knew what they were 
          doing tonight. I also got to close with the normal breakfast manager, 
          but she had worked this morning also, so she was pretty tired. I did 
          most of the manager's work for tonight, and she dealt with the things 
          I hadn't been trained for yet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got home tonight, 
          I tried to call Stacy, but no one answered the phone, so I rewrote her 
          letter about my reasons I love her. I think that this letter would be 
          best given to her in person. I may get up early this morning, after 
          I call her, and ride my bike over there to give it to her so she can 
          read it while she is at school. Man, that means that I have to get up 
          in 2 hours. Ok, so that's all for now. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This was my parents' (in 
          Hubbard) anniversary today. I just thought I would share that with the 
          general public. Last night I wrote Stacy a one-page letter on the computer, 
          using the new the-spot.net letterhead that I made. I think it still 
          needs some work, but the letter is more than likely going to make her 
          cry because it is sweet. Sorry, that is the best I can do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I went to 
          the meeting at Braum's. It was a little different this time. They informed 
          me of some new theft developments, as well as the next people on the 
          &quot;list&quot; to be fired. Four new people. *sigh* I have not seen 
          anyone put in an application YET that I would hire, period. But they 
          tend to follow in the footsteps of my old managers and just hire anyone 
          that THEY think would be good...or at least looks decent. Nope, that 
          is not where the money is...it is the people that look decent and are 
          intelligent enough to hold the job, and perform with high quality. And 
          actually, there are very few people at the store as of now that fit 
          that description. I think if I had to fire all the bad people, I would 
          end up keeping Tess, Rose, Dee, Stacy, Bea, Amber C, Cat, and Amber 
          B. Everyone else would have to go. (No, it is not a biased opinion on 
          Stacy...she works when she is there, and I find that attractive too, 
          but she does her job, and I don't hear anything about it.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">The Head of the Security 
          dept, what ever his title is, asked me questions about the whole missing 
          deposit scenario. So, I basically told him everything that I wrote in 
          my statement. Nothing new. However, he apparently knows why I was hired. 
          I think that I have impressed a number of people across the board up 
          in the corporate office, that I am unaware of. But he is still looking 
          to promote me, or someone up there is, because he asked what my schooling 
          plans were, and made reference to my good job of caring how the store 
          is run. (Even though I don't prefer to be called into work.) So I will 
          stick it out for a while longer...until I am unable to do so.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I talked to Stacy on the 
          phone today. I was reassured. At first we didn't have much to talk about, 
          because she was watching TV. But it finally got going, and we talked 
          about us, and came up with some date ideas, and I told her my plans 
          and everything. I also told her how I felt last night when she wouldn't 
          give me a straight answer over the phone about my coming to see her...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">She let me know that if 
          she is unavailable to see me, it is because she is busy. And also that 
          if she were going to break up with me, she would tell me flat out. That 
          is good. But she doesn't intend on breaking up with me. She says I am 
          too sweet to her, and make her feel special. She also says that she 
          would feel terrible if she cheated on me, because I am so nice. Well, 
          I am excited about her commitment. *Ladies, please note, that if a 16 
          year old can commit to a guy like this, then you should be able to as 
          well, if he treats you right.* I let her know about the way women did 
          me wrong in the past and that they were the reason that I asked if she 
          was going to be straight forward with her feelings; she says that it 
          was terrible for them to do that. I agree. I wish I had more to say 
          about this tonight, be we didn't get to talk for very long.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At 4:30 my dad came home 
          and we had to leave very shortly after that. Tonight was my stepsister's 
          graduation. (I think I am going to call her my sister now, because it 
          is easier to write than stepsister.) Anyway, she graduated from TCC, 
          and was about 1118 of 2000. Man it took forever - 2 hours isn't forever, 
          but in a poorly air-conditioned Convention Center, it seems like it. 
          Afterward we went to Denny's and ate breakfast/dinner/desert. I am still 
          stuffed from it. I had coffee (regular coffee) for the first time since 
          I have been here tonight. But only two cups. I think that I am at the 
          point that coffee doesn't even bother me when it comes to needing to 
          stay awake. Because shortly afterward, I fell asleep in the car on the 
          way home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At the graduation, though, 
          one speaker mentioned a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson, about his definition 
          of success. It is my quote of the day today. When I heard it, I realized 
          that I have fulfilled all of those criteria, and I almost had a moment. 
          Let me give examples of the certain criteria and how I have fulfilled 
          them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;To laugh often and 
          much...&quot; - I have been the happiest I have ever been since I moved 
          here, but even at college, I always made people smile when they were 
          having a bad day. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;To win the respect 
          of intelligent people...&quot; - I have shown numerous professors, bosses, 
          and others that I have excelled in their field, and thought of things 
          that they have never considered...that is why I have the job that I 
          have today.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;...and the affection 
          of children...&quot; - most recently, my neighbor's daughter, that has 
          not spoken much to me, has recently opened up to me and talked my ear 
          off last time she was here. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;...To earn the appreciation 
          of honest critics...&quot; - well, my friends don't cut me down about 
          the flaws in my websites, but they do inform me of things that could 
          do to be changed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;...and endure the 
          betrayal of false friends...&quot; - I have had plenty of women problems 
          in the past...but although I haven't had many friend problems, I have 
          had to deal with a couple of them bailing out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;to appreciate beauty...&quot; 
          - I received a piece of artwork from one of my best friends before I 
          left college, and for the first time, I realized that it doesn't matter 
          what I think about the drawing as far as how it could have been done 
          better or should look to be better, it is the beauty in the effort put 
          into it that matters. I nearly cried when I finally realized how it 
          all works, right then and there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;to find the best in 
          others...&quot;&nbsp; Stacy is a perfect example of this. From what 
          I know about her past, she would, on any other day, NOT be my first 
          choice for a girlfriend. However, (I don't know, I don't have any words 
          for this) but I have grown to love her for who she is. And even though 
          I find her attractive and as perfect as I need her to be, she sees that 
          she has flaws in her. I have overlooked them with a type of love that 
          doesn't care about what's wrong, only what is right.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;To leave the world 
          a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed 
          social condition...&quot; - I have spoken with Amy and Beth before on 
          this subject, and both of them cannot express the way that I have changed 
          their lives. Just last night, Amy was talking to me, and I told her 
          that I guess I was unsuccessful at changing her personality as far as 
          habits were concerned. But she informed me that I have changed her in 
          positive ways more than I will ever know. It is very comforting to see 
          that I have touched people's lives in such a permanent way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;To know even one life 
          has breathed easier because you have lived.&quot; - Jamie is one of 
          the girls I would talk to on a regular basis, while I was at school, 
          and in every conversation, my goal was to make her laugh. And I always 
          did. Even when she was having the most terrible day, she was always 
          made to laugh by something I said to her. Stacy is the newest girl that 
          I have been talking to. Every time we talk on the phone, she tells me 
          that she always feels special afterwards. I simply tell her how I feel 
          about her, which is enough to make her realize that she has someone 
          that really loves her and cares about her. I don't know if she has ever 
          had that in her life before, on a &quot; real&quot; basis. But I do 
          know that she is feeling happier about herself, and her situation now 
          that we are together. And I hope she realizes that she can take comfort 
          in the FACT that I will never do anything to hurt her feelings intentionally 
          or unintentionally, because I don't want to lose her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;This is to have succeeded.&quot; 
          - And up until now, I thought that I have wasted the last 20 years of 
          my life because I am now no where that I had anticipated being when 
          I was younger. But it turns out I have been working on success the entire 
          time, and have succeeded...now what? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I got my first credit 
          card today, with a $500 credit limit. I didn't think this one was coming, 
          so I sent in for a Capital One card this morning, and then this afternoon, 
          I get this one for being on the dean's list. Oh well. I am now up-to-date 
          with the times. And after depositing my check, and counting all the 
          bills I will have to pay for the next month, I will have about $200 
          left over to spend, including the date money taken out. So I will probably 
          wait until I get my next check and see how much that gives me, and then 
          buy my palm-pilot. After that, I will get a cell phone. Then I will 
          have to start saving money for college, since I will probably not get 
          any financial aid.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ok, I have left out a good 
          number of details from the graduation tonight, and some random things 
          that Stacy and I talked about, but that is ok. You don't need to know 
          everything. I am getting on the internet briefly tonight, and then I 
          am going to bed. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I didn't have to do 
          anything. So I planned to get up and lounge around the house for a while, 
          and wait to call Stacy when she got home. Hopefully I would be able 
          to go over and see her today after school. But that didn't come to fruition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Around lunch time, I went 
          with my step mom to Grandbury to pick up my stepbrother for his doctor's 
          appointment. The whole time, I was planning what I was going to do when 
          I got back home. All I could come up with was call Stacy and see if 
          she was busy, and if it was ok for me to come over or not. And after 
          that, I don't know. I planned on bringing a game over when I came so 
          that we would have something to do other than just be physical. There 
          has to be more to a relationship than physics - like chemistry <img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          .</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we got home, I called, 
          and no one was there. I was concerned that she got called into work 
          today. I also received a call from Braum's from one of the assistant 
          managers, wanting me to call back when I got home. I wasn't about to 
          get called in though on my days off. They know that if I am not on the 
          schedule, I am on vacation, and already have plans made. And I do really...I 
          plan my week around my first proposed work schedule, and don't have 
          any room for adjustments. And as soon as I get my new schedule, and 
          synchronize it with Stacy's, we are going to the movies, to see Matrix: 
          Reloaded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I played with my neighbor's 
          daughter, who is about 5 I think, today when I got home, because I had 
          nothing else better to do and she was over at our house while her mom 
          went to the bank or something. She loves to talk and talk and talk. 
          It is hard for me to carry on a conversation with her, because she is 
          so young and I don't know if she knows what I am talking about. But 
          we did...I let her do most of the talking. Then we went outside and 
          played with the dog. That is when Stacy called, so I had to stop playing 
          with her, and talk on the phone. I think she was a little distracted 
          when I left to talk on the phone, but I did wait until she went inside 
          before I went inside...I didn't think it was safe for her to be out 
          there with a dog as big as she was.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Stacy and I only got to 
          talk for about 15-20 minutes before the phone died, again. She was busy 
          cleaning and stuff. I had asked her if she wanted me to come over, but 
          she wouldn't give me a direct answer...<img src="../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          so I took it as a no, and went on with the conversation until the phone 
          died. We left the conversation with my planning to call her back tonight 
          and tomorrow.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I did call her back, 
          she missed her tv show because she was still cleaning, but was almost 
          done. She likes to watch Gilmore Girls, and Everwood...two of my favorite 
          shows. (We tend to have a lot of &quot;commons&quot; and &quot;differences&quot;...we 
          suppose that is what attracts us to each other. This is going to be 
          a task to try to not be so outspoken of what she does...but I am doing 
          good so far.) I did let her know though, that when she doesn't want 
          to do something with me, or doesn't want me to do something, then she 
          can just say &quot;no.&quot; She doesn't have to worry about hurting 
          my feelings. Now, if she plays me, then it will be a problem...or leads 
          me on. But she says she won't do that. I believe her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">All this showed me that 
          she is somewhat of an independent woman...but she still likes me, and 
          that is a good thing. I guess I need the reassurance from her nearly 
          every day. Today it was that she retraced the &quot;Stacy Loves Chris&quot; 
          inking that I put on her hand. Then people at school asked her about 
          it. So did her sister. Apparently her sister didn't know that she and 
          I were boyfriend/girlfriend. Hmm...what else would we be if we were 
          sitting on the couch doing what we did? I dunno. But she had some things 
          to say about it to Stacy, and Stacy told her off...and they left it 
          at that. I am kinda curious why Lauren even cares...she didn't care 
          when she had her chance...it's too late now. I don't date the same girl 
          twice. Policy. And I like Stacy...I'm not giving her up...she is going 
          to have to give me up, and according to her, she doesn't see any reason 
          to break up with me...I've done nothing wrong, and &quot;don't do anything 
          bad, at all.&quot; So I guess we're stuck together...sweet!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So, I returned the gesture, 
          and tried as I might, I redrew the &quot;Chris Loves Stacy&quot; inking 
          that she put on my hand first...but I had to use my left hand, so it 
          doesn't look the best. But it is there. This will be interesting to 
          see how it all plays out at work now that they will be seeing this on 
          our hands. It will have to come off eventually - probably tomorrow morning 
          before my meeting. I don't need the other crew managers ragging on me 
          about dating &quot;the family&quot; or being in my business period. 
          But that is life. I would sacrifice my reputation for Stacy if I had 
          to, because I think that she is worth it. But would I die for her? Hmm...that 
          would mean that I &quot;loved&quot; her. Well, I tend think that I would...but 
          that would have to be something I thought on more before I actually 
          tell her that I &quot;love&quot; her. See, it means something more to 
          me than &quot;I really really like you.&quot; That is why I hold off 
          on it, usually until I am ready to tell the girl that I want to marry 
          her. We'll see how this all works out. It is only day 3 after all...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I cleaned my room today...I 
          do that when I have extra energy that doesn't get used from talking 
          on the phone when I expect to. I also took some time to watch Gilmore 
          Girls, and Smallville. After that was when I called Stacy back. Then 
          I played on the Playstation against my stepsister in Tekken, Frogger 
          2, and Driver. I won. Yeah, she doesn't play much anymore...simpy because 
          I always win. Oh well...we spent some quality time together and listened 
          to music that she got from her new &quot;boyfriend&quot;...they're actually 
          just dating. But it's whatever.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I talked to Amy finally 
          tonight. She has moved back home to Kilgore, and is going to North Dakota 
          on June 2nd. That is the same day that I start back to school. We had 
          an in depth conversation about relationships and dating and the dos 
          and don'ts. We always have the most interesting conversations online. 
          Her and Beth are the two best people to talk to about those things for 
          me. They have been a good positive source for my relationship inquiries. 
          Amy plans on seeing me sometime soon, before she goes off to ND, but 
          she doesn't know when, or hasn't told me yet, one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">And finally, I printed some 
          pictures of myself out for Stacy. One is a big poster-sized photo, and 
          the other is a smaller version of the same picture. She doesn't have 
          a picture of me, and her walls are bare in her room...so I figured I 
          would help her out there some. I am probably going to let her borrow 
          my TV too...but I worry about her brother destroying it. I should probably 
          get some kind of compensation for it, as a deposit in case her brother 
          destroys it because he doesn't like me, or something. It may be best 
          for me to not even give it to them to use, in case that happens. Stacy 
          and her mom are the only two that are on good terms with me at the moment. 
          I do feel bad for her having to live in that house with the problems 
          it has. But I plan to take good care of her while she and I are together. 
          Heh, any girl that is willing to give me a full fledged chance at being 
          my girlfriend, is well worth the effort. I anticipate her mother wanting 
          me to be with her for a long time, once she meets me and sees how well 
          I treat her daughter. (I think I am lacking in the reassurance today...something 
          went wrong somewhere.)</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, today was a wonderful 
          day. Allow me to explain...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I had to get up early today 
          to get a check from the folks so that I could pay off college tuition 
          for this summer. Then I went back to be until 12:00 or so. Then I got 
          up and got ready, but noticed that my dad was home. I guess his allergies 
          were acting up too much for him to go to work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So, as I was getting ready 
          for departure, I got a call from Stacy. Apparently she missed the bus 
          this morning, and her mom let her stay home. Perfect. I added a destination 
          to my route for when I was going. I got to TCC and paid my bills, and 
          got a parking permit. The line to the business office moves considerably 
          faster than the line for the registrars office. I was happy about that. 
          Then I was off to Stacy's.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went there, unsure of 
          what was going to happen while I was there, but it all worked out. We, 
          her, Lauren, and I, all sat on the couch and watched TV the entire time 
          I was there. She showed me the rooms of her house, and she was right, 
          they don't have much in there at all. It looks nice though, since there 
          is nothing cluttering up the floors in the majority of the house...but 
          not in her room...it is a mess.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I only intended to stay 
          there a short while because I didn't know how everything would all play 
          out. But we watched tv for about an hour and a half, then Lauren went 
          to her room and took a nap, I assume, and Stacy and I just chilled on 
          the couch for the rest of the time. We talked, held hands, and snuggled. 
          Good stuff. I must say that, although I am not entirely pleased with 
          the things she has done in the past, at the moment she is the exact 
          girl I have been looking for.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Her brother came home, and 
          I got a negative impression of him from the moment he walked into the 
          door. He only confirmed it when he spoke, and went outside with a baseball 
          bat and started hitting things. I feel bad that those girls and their 
          mom have to live with this kid. He needs a good leather belt taken to 
          his behind and a man in the house that will knock the sh** out of him 
          if he disrespects one of them. I know he doesn't like me because when 
          I called her back later, he said in the background &quot;I don't like 
          Chris, bring back Kenny.&quot; (Her best friend, that she thinks is 
          annoying...so probably just a friend now.) But that's ok...I don't like 
          him either, and am not really concerned what he thinks about me. I am 
          not there to please him, I am interested in his sister. If he likes 
          Kenny so much, why doesn't he hang out with him, and then Kenny will 
          leave Stacy alone...? Sounds like a plan to me!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I have gotten spoiled 
          today, by being able to spend 5 hours with the girl I like, and wish 
          I could do it almost every day. But I know I can't and she can't. We 
          both have school and work, and I have more responsibilities. Speaking 
          of school, I will be starting summer school at TCC on June 2-July 7 
          - Monday thru Thursday. That means that I will have my birthday off. 
          Hopefully I can getoff of work for my birthday so that Beth and Benji 
          and Jay and Kati, and Stacy can see me that day, or that weekend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So that is all for tonight. 
          I'm outty. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, it was Mother's 
          Day. I woke up about 11:15 to do my laundry...but it was to the sound 
          of my step-sister knocking on my door telling me it was time to get 
          up. I didn't have much time before I went to work, just enough to do 
          my laundry and eat some lunch. I had hotdogs while I watched something 
          on the Discovery-Time channel about Navy Seal training. Then I watched 
          something on the regular Discovery Channel about the Bermuda Triangle. 
          It was very interesting, but I still don't know how people can just 
          disappear in the triangle...it makes me want to go try it someday, to 
          see what would happen, but I don't because of the possibility that it 
          just MIGHT happen to me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today we had a barbecue, 
          that I couldn't go to because I had to work. All of our relatives, or 
          at least the closest ones, came over for mother's day to hang out here. 
          But I was working, I only got to see Kristopher, my stepbrother, before 
          I left.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Stacy was not supposed to 
          be at work until 3:30 today, so I was a little surprised, and a little 
          disappointed I must say, to see her there working the drive through 
          when I walked in the door. That would mean that she is not closing, 
          and it getting off early. Which, she was supposed to now, at 7:00. But 
          something happened, and she had to stay to close. I don't think she 
          minded as much this time as she would have if I weren't there. She likes 
          working with me, and I with her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight, my other Assistant 
          Manager didn't really care what we did as far as duties went. Everyone 
          picked where they wanted to be, and no one complained about their assigned 
          post. So, Stacy and I did drive thru. She did most of the running, although 
          I tried to get her to stay at the register. She just kept leaving to 
          make ice creams. I did, however, take some of the treats away from her 
          while she was making them, because the vanilla was too hard for her 
          to be scooping...so I did it for her and finished those orders up. She 
          was grateful. Man! People kept ordering and ordering Banana Splits like 
          we were running out of bananas tomorrow! It was insane, plus the fact 
          that the vanilla ice cream was rock hard made it even worse.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, Stacy and I flirted 
          some times, when no one was looking. We are doing a pretty good job 
          of just pretending to be friends at work. Although I am afraid that 
          people are going to catch on sooner or later. I did get to hold her 
          hand tonight, while we were on break. She hadn't had a break the entire 
          time she was there, and I waited until after we closed to get a break 
          because we were way too busy for me to just go sit down. So we both 
          took our break at the same time. She has soft, cold hands. I like them 
          a lot...especially since my hands are usually warm. She showed me her 
          ring that she has been wearing. It is turned a certain way when the 
          girl is single, and turned the other direction when the girl is taken. 
          She turned it right side up for me <img src="../images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . To me, that kinda secured the relationship, and gave it a sense of 
          significance (as far as I was concerned about what she thought).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">*sigh* I think it is time 
          for me to go to bed...this has been an interesting and amazing first 
          day, and I have a lot to think about, concerning Stacy. Laterz. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ok, so today was a total 
          De'ja Vous. There were only two differences. This morning, I didn't 
          want to wake up because I had to mow the lawn. It was terrible. You 
          would think we were rednecks or something the way the backyard looked. 
          I am surprised I didn't find a car back there in all that grass. It&nbsp; 
          seemed like it took forever, but it only took about an hour to do both 
          the front and back yards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, I made some barbecue 
          beef, which wasn't all that great this time. Then I went and called 
          Stacy. I told her I would call her in the morning. So I tried, but no 
          one answered. I figured that they stepped out for a bit, and that they 
          could check their caller ID when they got home. So I decided to play 
          a little Tekken while I layed on my bed. I beat the game twice with 
          Law, and the blonde girl, who's name escapes me right now. Then I tried 
          to call again, but someone changed the ringer to 1 ring, before the 
          answering machine kicked in. So they're home, but just not answering 
          the phone. OK.&nbsp; That's cool...she will call me back if she wants 
          to talk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So I decide to take a nap, 
          and as soon as I get comfortable, *ring ring*, it rings. We talk, and 
          talk, and talk. She told me about a dream she had last night after we 
          got off the phone. She, I, Kenny (her friend) and Lauren were all in 
          it. She and I shared a room, with separate water beds (since we both 
          want a waterbed) and Kenny and I were fighting over who gets to share 
          a room with Stacy. His argument &quot;I'm her best friend&quot;...my 
          argument &quot;Well, I'm her boyfriend.&quot; That right there got me 
          thinking... .oO(does she think of me as her boyfriend?) So I pondered 
          this question the rest of the day, and whether or not to bring it back 
          up...or put it in writing while at work, or wait until we got home tonight 
          to discuss it. I decided to wait.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I did get lucky tonight, 
          she wasn't supposed to work, but another employee got Pink Eye, and 
          she got called in to cover for this employee. She had two options, go 
          to the movies with Kenny (who annoys her terribly) or come to work with 
          me, at a place she doesn't want to be, but wants to see me. She chose 
          to come to work. I felt special then. We didn't get to talk too much 
          or flirt much at all tonight. But that is ok. She and I exchanged notes, 
          and I noticed two things that I enjoyed about her again tonight. One 
          being her dimples when she smiles. They are so cute. The other is her 
          voice. She has a sexy, non-typical female voice. She was doing drive 
          thru and I had a headset on so I could hear what all was being said, 
          and I enjoyed listening to her voice thoroughly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After work I took her home, 
          so that her mom wouldn't have to get up and come get her. Her mom was 
          very appreciative of that, and said &quot;who ever brought you home 
          tonight was a god.&quot; She was worn out from her work today, and was 
          dead asleep from the time she got home until the time Stacy got home, 
          and was dreading having to wake up to go get her. .oO(+5 pts for Chris 
          on the parental scale) I have yet to meet, much less even see her mom, 
          so I need all the brownie points I can get.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I thought about the dream 
          from last night, and decided to bring it up in conversation. I had to 
          word it carefully, so it wouldn't sound like I was pushing it on her, 
          because I didn't want to push anything onto her. I want this to work 
          out perfectly. I couldn't word it correctly after I had brought it up, 
          so I just had to say what I meant, because she was curious what I wanted 
          to know. I wanted to know what she thought of me as. If she thought 
          of me as her boyfriend, or not just yet. But she said that she &quot;could 
          if I wanted her to&quot;...and I told her that I &quot;wouldn't mind 
          it...it would be a good thing, but only if you are ready to do that. 
          I didn't want to push it on to you.&quot; So that settled it. We are 
          now boyfriend and girlfriend. I also let her know that I would not tell 
          her I &quot;love&quot; her until the day I ask her to marry me...simply 
          because that word means something to me. It's not a word to just be 
          thrown around. Too many people screw things up by telling other people 
          that. And she was ok with it. I also found out some disturbing things 
          about her past though, but I am going to try to overlook those that 
          it is possible to do so, and still like her for who she is. Those things 
          just help me better gauge how she will react to certain things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So that is all for tonight. 
          This will be interesting to see how this plays out at work, since she 
          was rescheduled to work the same shift as me tomorrow. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15">

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Man, today, I didn't want 
          to wake up this morning. I got up at 12:00, only because I had to do 
          my laundry, and then I went back to sleep for about 30 minutes or so, 
          only to get up and put it in the dryer. At that time, I decided that 
          I needed to get in the shower, so I took the opportunity to cut my hair. 
          It was getting kinda shaggy on the sides, and that bugs the heck out 
          of me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterwards, I ate my lunch, 
          and then called Stacy. I really enjoy talking to her. We talked until 
          her phone went dead. We always do that. I realized something tonight...that 
          is that I have never ended a conversation with her by saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; 
          we have always ended because her phone goes dead. Oh well...we talked 
          about all kinds of stuff....and normally, when I am talking on the phone, 
          I have the hardest time holding a conversation. But with her it is different. 
          She and I both have the same type of conversation skills...we both can 
          listen and then relate what the other is talking about, so that we end 
          up with more material to work with when we change subjects. It's like 
          a morning show on the radio, really.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went to work today, and 
          got to work with Stacy. I always enjoy working with her. She is the 
          primary reason that I haven't minded going to work these past couple 
          days. Usually I dread going to work. There wasn't much that happened 
          at work today though. It was just the same old stuff that happens every 
          Friday...people come and people go...all getting ice cream and food. 
          The interesting stuff didn't happen until got home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">For the first time, I called 
          Stacy after I got off work. She closed with me, but she got to leave 
          way before I did. We talked again, for about an hour, until her phone 
          went dead. We had plenty to talk about...but nothing in particular. 
          After that I had a turkey sandwich, and some crackers...then went to 
          work on the internet, and now I am off to bed. Laterz. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got up this morning, against 
          my will, at 6:15 to take my shower and get ready to go to school with 
          my step mom And I was ready to go by 6:45, so I ate a bowl of cereal 
          so I wouldn't be hungry. Well, as it turned out, at 7:00, BOTH the parents 
          were still in bed! Ok, so something wasn't right. So I asked if they 
          intended to go to work, and found out that my dad had a doctor's appointment, 
          and my step mom didn't have to be at work until 8:00, meaning she doesn't 
          get up until 7:00. *sigh* So I watched some MTV-2. I found a new band 
          on there called Jason Evans, or something like that. They were pretty 
          good. There is a post about it in the forum in the C:\My Music forum.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we got to the school, 
          I waited around and met with some of the faculty that was there so that 
          they would be used to seeing me around. Plus, I didn't know what my 
          step mom's job was, so I couldn't help her with it right off. Shortly 
          after that, she showed me how to answer the phones, and operate the 
          switch board. I also learned how to use the Region 10 software, that 
          has all the students' records in it. I have been trying to get in to 
          that for years while I was in school...and I found it on the network 
          once, but I didn't know any of the teacher's passwords, or login names, 
          so I couldn't do anything with it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I did work on that, 
          searching for students, and entering inventory for next year. My main 
          purpose for going was to get the pictures sent of Kris's prom and of 
          myself from the digital camera. They were huge pictures, so I downsized 
          them, and put them in a zip file...thanks to Benji for providing that 
          technique when he sent me files at etbu. (everything was in a zip file...heh.) 
          Anyway, once I compressed the pics to their max, and put them at 640*480, 
          the size went from 7MB to 600Kb<strong><font size="3">.</font></strong><font size="3"> 
          Pretty good compression.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Then I took the 
          task of fixing the office printer. It was something that they had had 
          everyone in the school look at, but no one could fix it. It kept printing 
          color or gray scale, even if they put it on black and white, which made 
          it hard to read the text. So I fiddled with it for about 10 minutes, 
          and got it fixed. I was a &quot;Miracle Worker&quot; according to my 
          step mom Nah, I am just a tech support professional.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got to eat lunch 
          with the faculty, principal, and VP. There was a cute teacher in there...kinda 
          hispanic, or something - tanned complexion, in her late 20s, actually 
          I believe she said that she was going to be 30 this weekend. Oh well...she 
          at lunch with us too. She was telling us how one of her students that 
          had bruises on his arms was informing her of a ghost at his old school 
          that attacked him when he went down the hallway, after the custodian 
          told him not to, because there was something down there. I don't buy 
          into it, but I am sure it was a convincing story, with a lot of details. 
          It reminded me of the stories my brother would tell folks, like &quot;my 
          mom was pregnant.&quot; The time he did that, he ended up getting the 
          whole class to make a poster board card, and they presented it to her 
          one day when she came to pick him up from school. Needless to say, the 
          teacher was a <em>little</em> disappointed. hehe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, I helped 
          the nurse with locating information on her Region 10 software. That 
          didn't take me as near as long as it takes her. So then I looked up 
          some House Bills for her and got the information about them off the 
          internet. Again, that didn't take as long as she expected. So I went 
          to the teacher's lounge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After I rested 
          for a while I wanted to go to the computer lab, but there were some 
          students in there, so I just went up to the front and sat back at the 
          desk to answer the phones and such. During this time I just worked on 
          her computer there. It is running Windows 2000, which is pretty close 
          to XP, and which I am familiar with and enjoy using. Plus the fact that 
          they had a LAN internet connection...so I used that to upgrade her computer 
          to all the latest Microsoft products and drivers, and critical updates. 
          Now it is as souped up as my stepsister's, but with better stuff since 
          it is after all Windows 2000.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">About that time, 
          it was time for students to get out of school. All of them want to use 
          the phone, and they have the gall to stand there, watch me tell a student 
          that he can't use the phone, and then ask me if they can use it. So 
          being the person that I am, not getting paid to be there, I informed 
          them that &quot;if I tell him that he can't use the phone, what makes 
          you think that you can use the phone? go to the discipline office and 
          use that phone if she will let you.&quot; It is not to be rude or mean, 
          but just because the only phone in the office is that one that is the 
          switch board, and if a student is on the phone, we cannot answer the 
          call and transfer it to where it needs to go.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I told one student 
          that he cannot use the phone, and he went home and told his mom. She 
          called back up there and proceeded to carry this conversations with 
          me...</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">&quot;Hi, my son 
          just came home and told me that he had a load of cookie dough that he 
          picked up from the cafeteria, and you were an a** hole about it and 
          wouldn't let him use the phone.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Yes, ma'am, I was instructed not to let any of the students use 
          the phone.&quot;<br>
          &quot;But why couldn't he use the phone, bastard?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Ma'am, I don't work here, so it is not going to do any good to 
          get up set with me, I am just telling them what I was told.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Yeah, that is the problem. You are the problem you stupid a** 
          hole. My son has the right to use the f***ing phone after school hours...&quot;<br>
          &quot;Ma'am, I was told not to let any of the students use the phone, 
          period. Maybe you should talk to the secretary or someone else. Hang 
          on and I will get her.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Why don't you do that, stupid a**.&quot;<br>
          &quot;Thank you, ma'am...HOLD.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So my step mom 
          came in and set her straight, and then put the phone on night rign, 
          and I didn't have to answer it anymore. But right before that, a girl 
          came in to pick up a student, claiming that the student's mom sent her 
          to get her. So I call the student on the PA system, and in a few seconds 
          later, get a call back from a teacher asking who is here to pick up 
          the student. I tell her the girl's name, and then the teacher says that 
          she will not release the student unless the mother is present, period. 
          Ok, I got no problem with that, and tell the girl what she says. I have 
          no idea which teacher it was that called, but the girl tells me that 
          she has been sent by the mother to get her, and calls the dad, but nothing 
          comes of that...if she even called. (This whole time, I am thinking, 
          girl, you are not scaring me one bit. I am NOT a student, I am NOT getting 
          paid for this, so if you don't get the f*** out of this office, you 
          are about to hear what I have to say.) However, she insists that I release 
          the student...but I tell her that I have no way of knowing who the student 
          is, or where she is. Anyway, it results in the girl leaving yelling 
          that she is going to get the GP police dept, and something is going 
          to happen here. So?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">*sigh* We went 
          to Golden Coral tonight, which I haven't been there in a looooong time. 
          It was all right. I got some steak but it wasn't very flavorful and 
          was somewhat not done all the way. I filled up though with crab salad, 
          fish, pasta, steak, pizza, and ice cream. All good stuff, but nothing 
          very healthy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got home, 
          I got a call from work from another assistant manager asking about a 
          deposit that was left Saturday night, but wasn't taken on Sunday morning. 
          They wanted to know when the last time I saw it was, and I told her 
          three times the same story, exactly as it happened. And she relayed 
          it to the District Manager, as I assume it was him in the background. 
          The other person that was there that night is in the hospital for some 
          reason, undisclosed, but I will soon find out. Anyway, they called back 
          and wanted to know the same thing, and what I thought was the code to 
          the safe. I don't know if I actually know it or not, but I have never 
          touched the top safe, and am not in a position to even care about where 
          the money went to, much less be responsible for who does and doesn't 
          do their job concerning the money. So if they are going to try to pin 
          this down on me, my dad can vouch for me because he picked me up every 
          night this week...and if that is not good enough, and I end up getting 
          fired for it, I will sue them. Otherwise, I can not be blamed for it. 
          I didn't touch the money, and haven't in a long time, done the deposit 
          myself.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got a letter 
          today from my step dad about my car. Apparently the deal has changed 
          concerning the holding of my belongings. They have decided the date 
          for me as to when I can pick up the car...which I have already made 
          plans for that day...but I don't think they would care if I called and 
          told them that. Ugh! And anything that I can't get that day, of my belongings, 
          will be sold or given away. What jerks. They told me that they would 
          hold my things until I moved out of my dad's house and into my own. 
          I guess they are planning on moving into a smaller house or something, 
          or maybe they are just changing the deal, like they did at least 10 
          times between December and March while I was back from etbu. No matter...if 
          they don't want me to be calling them anymore about things, then that 
          is fine with me. The only reason that I even bother to waste my phone 
          card minutes to call is for the posterity of my mother and I's relationship. 
          But it doesn't bother me to not ever call them again. I don't miss people 
          unless I become accustomed to spending time with them on a regular basis, 
          and can tell that they like/love me. Needless to say, I don't really 
          miss being over there. I did miss my friends at etbu, and still do miss 
          a good portion of them, but I have been on the internet long enough 
          that I don't really miss them all that much...although I would still 
          like to see them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, Stacy called 
          me tonight in the middle of the conversation with my parents about what 
          we will do on the 24th for the car incident. I called her back and we 
          talked for about an hour before her phone died. She will be buying a 
          new, regular phone when she gets paid Wednesday. I have found out that 
          she is attracted to me because of the fact that we are exact opposites...I 
          don't think that we are exact opposites, but we do have clashing opinions 
          on some things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I don't know if 
          I have made a mistake in telling her this or not, but she now knows 
          that she is the first girl that I liked when I started working there. 
          And I was excited when she wrote &quot;Chris Loves Stacy&quot; on a 
          slip of paper and gave it to me. I knew that she meant it the other 
          way around. BUT, I also learned something about Lauren...that is that 
          she knew that I liked Stacy. She said one day &quot;Stacy, I think Chris 
          likes you...&quot; and then the next day she flirted with me, and I 
          thought she meant something by it, but it was just a set up....and then 
          she told Stacy, &quot;Hehe, I got a date with Chris tomorrow&quot;...Sheesh, 
          women. I am glad that it turned out this way though. I really like her 
          a lot, and am glad to see that she handles relationships differently 
          than most girls these days do, in the city. She and I have been talking 
          on the phone for a while now, and I am glad that we are taking this 
          slow enough to get to know each other before we get into something that 
          will just cause us problems if we don't know the other person. Now, 
          if I could only know when would be a good time for us to actually have 
          a title. Oh well, I am not going to rush it...I have time, she has time, 
          and we like each other.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I wanted to do 
          some work on the site tonight, but I just couldn't bring myself to focus 
          or be motivated to make any more pages, since my internet kept crashing 
          my computer while I was trying to make them. Oh well...it is late now, 
          and I can sleep in tomorrow...but I still have laundry to do. Oh, and 
          Stacy got put on the schedule to work tomorrow, so that is always a 
          good thing...because I have to work too...although I would rather work 
          at the middle school than at Braum's...it is a little more stress free 
          at the school. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I jumped out 
          of bed at 9:00, because Amy was supposed to call some time before I 
          went to work. I looked on the caller ID, and found a number, that I 
          though was her's, and searched my address book for it. No where in there. 
          It was an 816 number, she has a 903. Then I went back to sleep. About 
          11:15, I realized that I had a manager meeting at Braum's at 10:00...oops. 
          Oh well, they never do anything there but argue anyway, and I wasn't 
          going to ride my bike an hour trip to sit there for an hour to hear 
          that. If I am going to come to one, I am going to have to already be 
          there in the first place on the clock.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I worked today with Stacy 
          and Amber. So, I must say, that this was a fun night. I saw Stacy's 
          new hair coloring. She's cute - although I didn't mind just the brown 
          hair she had before. Tonight, I got to compare both of the girls' maturity 
          levels against each other. As it goes, Amber is a little more energetic 
          and talkative than Stacy. Stacy works (which I find attractive) and 
          doesn't talk so much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I must attribute the energy 
          of Amber though, to the fact that she has a guy's phone number, and 
          there is a guy that would be interested in talking to her. According 
          to sources, not many guys care to talk to her...makes me wonder, but 
          I don't really think about it. I don't care what's wrong with those 
          guys. So, I am in the predicament of choosing, but not choosing right 
          now. All I have to do is be friends to both of them, until one of them 
          wants to take it further. It will be up to them. Heh...it's really very 
          simple. They both have my phone number, and can call me anytime, so 
          the ball is in their court. (However, I also have Stacy's number, but 
          we call each other on our days off.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I don't work tomorrow, so 
          I am going to help my step mom at her school she works at. I am actually 
          going there to try to send some pictures that were too big to send via 
          email. It is now my job to find out how to get them from there to here. 
          I already have it figured out, so it shouldn't take me long at all. 
          It's just what am I going to do while I am there and have finished the 
          picture project? I may take my software packet with me, and play some 
          games or get on the internet or something. So, since I am going to be 
          doing that, I have to go to bed now. I have to get up at 6:15 this morning.

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I got up this morning 
          and cleaned the bathroom before I did anything on the computer. That 
          way I was sure to get it done. After that though, I worked on the site, 
          trying to get the birthday script that I came up with yesterday translated 
          into php. I thought everything was going well, until later today when 
          I ran across an error, in something that I thought was written correctly. 
          It just goes to show that I still don't know what I am doing with php, 
          so I can't program it yet until I learn more.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I watched Waterboy today 
          on USA, and ate lunch. My stepsister came home about that time, and 
          she watched it with me. I decided to make ice cream for later today, 
          and she made some guacamole. But in my ice cream I put a little too 
          much vanilla, so it tasted like it was alcoholic. It wasn't that imitation 
          vanilla, it was actual vanilla from Mexico.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, while that was making, 
          we watched the Princess Bride. Good movie. I saw it once before at etbu, 
          during a band thing I was invited to go to, but didn't realize that 
          I had seen the whole thing in that one sitting. I thought I had only 
          seen parts. About that time, I was thinking that I should call Stacy, 
          but I wanted to be sure that she had enough time to do her homework.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Consequently, she called 
          me instead. I was excited. A girl actually calling me to talk. Not waiting 
          only for me to call her. I like that - a lot. Some initiative. We talked 
          for an hour and 15 minutes before she had to go eat and her phone kept 
          cutting out. Of course, when I am on the phone that long, I have to 
          move around the house so that I don't run out of material to talk about. 
          I went to the living room, my bed room, and then back to the living 
          room.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we hung up, the first 
          time, I went up stairs and started to play some Tekken, but my stepsister 
          wanted to play dominos. So I consented, and played her. I beat her by 
          10 points, in the final score. We only played to 370. It was fun. I 
          always wondered why the black kids at etbu's Feagin lobby slammed the 
          dominos down on the tables. It is because they are getting 20+ points 
          in a play. There was a little slamming going on of our own here tonight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, I called Stacy 
          back and talked to her for another 30 minutes or so. She was reading 
          me a magazine quiz about &quot;Does the guy like you?&quot; Interesting 
          thing to bring up over the phone...so I answered for her, the things 
          that I would do out of the choices. She concluded that I liked her...and 
          I agreed. Earlier, we had talked about playing Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and 
          how I had won $1 million on the video game, but never actually called 
          in to play on tv. I am confident that I could get at least 32K if not 
          the entire million. She said that if I had actually won the million, 
          that she would like me even more...(you have to like me in the first

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went up to TCC today to 
          see if I could get some financial aid for this summer. I got an Asian 
          lady that didn't speak english very well. She told me that I couldn't 
          spread my loans out over three semesters, skipping one in the middle...and 
          that if I got a loan for this summer, then I wouldn't have one in the 
          fall. That is pretty jacked up, especially since they lead me to believe 
          that I still had viable financial aid for this summer. So I have decided 
          to take a hit to the pocket book, once again, and pay for my classes 
          out of pocket. That is going to be about $230 for 6 hours. Perhaps I 
          will appreciate them more since I will be paying for them myself, and 
          not through scholarships or loans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">For the most part, I enjoyed 
          work today. I worked with Amber. I did the drive through and she was 
          my runner. She wasn't as fast tonight as she was last time she and I 
          did drive through. I think I will have one of the other people do it 
          next time. (Stacy and I work together, as well as Amber, Wednesday, 
          I will probably have her be my runner.) Ahh, as you can tell, yes, I 
          believe I have made a mistake. But that is not uncommon. I gave my phone 
          number to Amber tonight, and it was a well worked conversation entry. 
          She was talking about how she got drunk this weekend, and I asked why 
          she gets drunk. Her response was that so she could act crazy....she 
          didn't really know why she did it, just to do it I guess. So I told 
          her that this weekend, she should try to have fun without being drunk. 
          If she can't seem to do it, give me a call, and we will go do something 
          together that will be fun, and we won't get drunk. She consented. Now 
          if you have been keeping up with my journal, then you can put two and 
          two together and get none. But if you haven't, then I will not cut my 
          nuts out-right for you. I have made a grave mistake...you'll find out 
          soon. I did give Amber my web site address, and she knows I have a journal 
          on her, and that her name might be appearing in it, so don't be shocked. 
          However, I am relatively safe, because she told me that she doesn't 
          know how to do anything on the computer but burn CDs. I had to explain 
          to her step by step how to get to the site, starting from the time she 
          connected to MSN.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I am not too concerned 
          about it. I am not currently dating either one of them, but not much 
          more than talking to both of them...actually just talking to Stacy on 
          the phone. Speaking of which I'd better call her tomorrow. I will be 
          bored tomorrow, since I am off work. Hopefully Stacy will want to go 
          do something, but that is up to her. I'm not going to bring it up again. 
          I mentioned it in passing on Sunday, and there was no comment. Like 
          I said in other entries, I am going to take this one slow. I really 
          like her, and from what it appears, she likes me...what it <em>appears</em> 
          , mind you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight I didn't do much 
          work on the site. I was pretty bored and tired. I did, however, during 
          my break at work, figure out the pseudocode for the Birthday script 
          that Akari took from anime-kingdom.net, and hopefully I will be able 
          to implement that into my site before offering it to Anime-Kingdom. 
          It isn't very hard at all - the only problem I have is translating the 
          c++ and java coding I used into php...a language that I don't really 
          know. We'll see what happens.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My stupid hermit crabs are 
          acting up lately. They were getting feisty last night so I put them 
          in the same cage to run around and play with each other. Lately they 
          have been climbing all over the walls and ceiling of the cage, and tearing 
          up their water sponge. I'm not sure why, but they are weird all of the 
          sudden. I guess I should put more water in their cage, or perhaps put 
          water in the bottom of their cage like I did to begin with.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I woke up 
          at 10:25, the exact time we were supposed to be leaving for church. 
          But for some reason, about 9:00 or so, we had a brownout, and my clock 
          was reset, so my alarm didn't go off. It never fails, every Sunday morning 
          that I have off, getting to church is always a hassle. But we got to 
          church nonetheless. We arrived at perfect timing, they were greeting 
          everyone. So we just walked right in. This time around people kept shaking 
          my hand before and after the service. I was happy to see that some of 
          them remembered me and were willing to talk to me, so I did my best 
          to hold conversation with them, as I was able.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After church we went to 
          the grocery store and picked up some stuff for dinner. My step mom cooked 
          a roast in the crock-pot, which I was excited...we were finally going 
          to have a real dinner. But the thing about it was that it was going 
          to be &quot;dinner,' not lunch. So I had a couple turkey sandwiches 
          and then went to the computer to see what I could see.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I met Gigz today for the 
          first time, and he and I worked on www.anime-kingdom.net to help restore 
          their forums after the recent ousting of the old administrator. She 
          left the forum to him, and didn't tell him anything about it, and then 
          took her scripts. Fortunately I had jacked a copy of some of them to 
          use on my forums, and was able to help him restore some of the design 
          features. However, there are some things, like the random picture display 
          and a birthday php script that I cannot replace at the moment because 
          of either a lack of resources or a lack of knowledge, but they are soon 
          to be contained problems. This evening I checked back on the forums 
          and there were a number of people expressing their gratitude to me for 
          helping out with their site, being a complete stranger to it and all. 
          My first post was to tell them that Gigz and I were undertaking the 
          task of restoring the site to the original design, and that it would 
          be a daunting endeavor.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After I finished with that, 
          we played Hand 'n Foot, and for the first two rounds I lost, and was 
          in last place. But in the third round, I told my parents that I was 
          going to beat them...and did, barely. My step mom only had one card 
          left before she went out...that put me in 2nd place. Then in the next 
          and last round, I went out before either of them put up any stacks, 
          which gave them both a negative total, and me the lead by 1000 points. 
          hehe...cut-throat cards <img src="../images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15">

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I went to evening church, 
          hoping to see Natalie, but she didn't show up. My friends there said 
          that she hasn't been coming for a while, only on occasional Wednesday 
          nights. I wonder if she only came to take me there. Hmm...but anyway, 
          I will give her a call, and find out why she hasn't been going...the 
          next time I will be going though is undecided...because I don't have 
          Wed. or Sun. off this week.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After church I got to call 
          Stacy back. I really enjoy talking to her on the phone. She would probably 
          be the only person that I will talk to on the phone on a regular basis. 
          We have a lot to say to each other, and that is what is lacking in other 
          phone conversations. Her phone kept cutting out though, and finally 
          gave out...otherwise we would have talked until her bedtime...if not 
          shortly afterward. I must say that I am quite taken in by her, but I 
          can't act like it, otherwise things might become more difficult at work 
          for me. I really don't need anymore rumors spread about me there...and 
          as for this journal entry, no one at work knows about this site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I watched Mr. Deeds tonight 
          after talking with Stacy. It was a good movie. My stepsister came in 
          and watched it with me too after she got off of work. She fell asleep 
          though before it ended...she is not a night person. I may make it a 
          point to watch a movie every Sunday night or something...that way I 
          can give reviews for people that still haven't seen the movie...like 
          me, even though I have had this movie since last semester, this was 
          my first time to actually watch it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I worked on the home page 
          tonight, and got a scrolling marquee, as you might have noticed. I also 
          posted a couple more things on AK. I am now up to 4 posts there. I have 
          about 20 different one liners for t-shirts that I thought of while I 
          was at church tonight. (I just couldn't get into his message).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I am sleepy now...and 
          I have to make the trek to TCC tomorrow to go to the financial aid office 
          and get my stuff straightened out. Hopefully I can still use my loans, 
          and still get everything paid for for this summer's courses. Laterz.</font></p>

          to TCC and take care of my financial stuff. So, I went, on my bike...a 
          20 minute drive there. It was humid outside. And guess what...they were 
          closed. So I got a FAFSA for next year and filled out as much as I could, 
          then came home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">On my way back home, I stopped 
          by Kroger and decided to look around for some treats. I kept seeing 
          the prices for Kroger Plus card holders, and then I noticed the regular 
          prices...they are outrageous!. It is almost as if they want to assimilate 
          everyone into the Kroger Plus Club. So I conceded and got a card. I 
          just haven't turned in my application yet. I will also get one from 
          Albertson's when I stop by there next. It doesn't hurt, since they are 
          free, and bring great savings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work today, nothing went 
          as planned. One girl was called in early, and one of the crew managers 
          was called in early, so they both got to leave early...and another crew 
          manager called in Sick...or unstable. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_smite2.gif" width="125" height="30">&nbsp; 
          Do you know how many times I wanted to call into work because the wind 
          was blowing against me on my way to work? Too many times. And this lady 
          calls in because her blood pressure is high, and she doesn't think she 
          is mentally stable enough to come in. I don't think she is mentally 
          stable enough to have a job here, personally. But I am not the boss.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I am happy to say that there 
          is some good news today...while I was out this morning, Stacy called. 
          I am sad that I missed her, but I am happy that she called. I guess 
          I will try to call her tomorrow night when she gets off work, but I 
          don't know exactly when that will be. Hopefully she could get off in 
          time to go to church with me, but I think she might end up working until 
          8:00. I already have set aside time on my calendar to go do things with 
          her, should she be available certain days. Oh, well....i am just happy 
          that the person that I was originally interested in also returns an 
          interest in me....or at least it appears as though she does. We'll take 
          this one slow and see what happens. Now that I have talked to Aerel 
          (on the forums) about how things work with girls &quot;these days,&quot; 
          I should be able to handle things a little better than in the past.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today I was woken up by 
          my stepsister. All I understood was &quot;Get up...parents...IHOP...be 
          ready when they get here.&quot; Sweet...we are going to IHOP! Not so. 
          She actually said, &quot;the parents are at IHOP and they are going 
          to take you to do your driving test today. Be ready when they get here.&quot; 
          Oh well...at least I get to do my driving test.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We went to Grand Prarie, 
          and I got to drive the T. Blazer there. I was about the fourth one to 
          take the test. The girl in front of me was TERRIBLE! The first thing 
          that they started off with was the parallel parking. I have had no problem 
          with that since the first time I tried it and got it right. This girl 
          was at least another car's width away from the poles when she pulled 
          up next to the poles, and tried to do it at that distance. Needless 
          to say, it didn't work. But right before that, she had to get the car 
          there, by driving it. The trooper was in the car, and between 1 ft and 
          3 ft, she slammed on the breaks and threw them forward with a jolt, 
          as stereotyped in commercials about Driver's Ed. Man...she was no good.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When the trooper came back, 
          he and the girl, and her mom went inside. My dad says that when the 
          trooper goes inside with you, it's never a good sign. It wasn't. They 
          took a good 20 minutes or so to come back out. Then it was our turn. 
          Before we went on the test though, my dad and I strategically talked 
          to the guy to get to know him better and make &quot;friends&quot; with 
          him. He told us that the girl was deducted 63 points from 100 total. 
          He was on a perfect streak since he started this morning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, we took my test, 
          and I did the parallel parking in the first shot. I got counted off 
          for not checking the blind spots, and something else. Then we did a 
          brief little bit of driving around the town close by the office. In 
          all, I only lost 14 points. I made an 86...which was what I made on 
          my written test. That is the story of my life though, 86 - everything 
          is about average, when it could be so much better.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So, I now have a license, 
          and am now insured on my parents' cars. I tried to get the information 
          for my car from my other parents, but they are being very picky about 
          things. All I can do is hope that they are going to give me the car 
          with no hassle...I have paid for it and met all their requirements for 
          getting the car, and I am not going to do anything else about it. I 
          didn't have to have insurance of my own for the car, so my dad could 
          put me on their insurance if they wanted. Now I may have to call the 
          insurance people and find out if everything is done correctly...or if 
          there was a miscommunication somewhere along the lines, but I think 
          I am ok now. Plus, I can now go on dates <img src="../images/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Speaking of dates...that 
          leads me to work. And you can probably guess where I am going with this 
          one...but I will get to that in a second. Tonight, I ran the show. I 
          was the Manager in charge, and the people took advantage of me in that. 
          It's ok, they have a big surprise for them tomorrow night though. We 
          are going to clean clean clean! There will not be a spot of dirt left 
          on that store floor, or dishes or cabinets. and I have the manager and 
          two other assistant managers there to help me ensure it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">But back to the other point. 
          Seeing as how I was determined to give Stacy my phone number, I did 
          tonight. I also wrote a note on it not to let anyone know here at work, 
          not even her sister...but I don't know how she is going to keep it from 
          her sister. I personally don't care. I liked Stacy from the first day 
          anyway, and Lauren just happened. It works out like that sometimes...it 
          happened around Thanksgiving last semester too...I liked one girl, and 
          another girl happened. Needless to say, that didn't last very long. 
          But that is where I have learned how to handle things like this. Stacy 
          and I are going to get to know each other more before we, or I really, 
          commit to anything. I have spoken with Aerel on the forums, and she 
          explained how things should be with the girls of today. And it makes 
          sense, even from a Canadian's point of view. So that is how I am going 
          to handle it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I didn't do too much work 
          on the site tonight, just basically checked the posts made during the 
          day, which there were a lot of. I plan to do a good portion of the work 
          on Sunday, since that is my next day off...and I will not be able to 
          do anything else responsible between the church services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Hopefully I will be able 
          to hang out with Natalie some on Sunday. I haven't seen her in nearly 
          3 weeks or so, since she lost her DL. Since then she has gotten a new 
          one, I just haven't been available to go to church with her, and we 
          haven't talked much. I guess that is ok, since I am sure it was putting 
          her boyfriend in a precarious position when she and I were together. 
          Trust me, I know all too well how that feels. And that is a good and 
          a bad thing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana"> Anyway, I'm out. Hopefully 
          Stacy will call me tomorrow morning, and we can go see Matrix 2 on the 
          15th or something. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ahh...finally my day off. 
          I didn't want to do anything today...except go to the bank. I had to 
          make sure I did that, because I sent in my last car payments today. 
          Now, I hope I can get it by the 14th of May.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">While I was out, I went 
          to Office Depot and looked at the palm-pilots they had there. I did 
          find a pocket PC from microsoft and toshiba that I liked, and there 
          was a $100 rebate, but that expired today, so I didn't pay much attention 
          to it. It is $299 otherwise. But, while I was in the store, it started 
          raining, so I decided to head home. (And, as I do not have my car yet, 
          I was on bike.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">During my ride, it started 
          to hail...this was very interesting. Although the hail was falling all 
          around me, God decided to not let any of it hit me in the head. That 
          was very nice of him. I collected some of the biggest ones from the 
          front yard when I got home, and they were about marble sized at the 
          most. The power surged and we lost our satellite connection for the 
          tv, so I couldn't watch VH1 anymore. So I resorted to the old fashioned 
          method of entertainment...Tekken <img src="../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . It was frustrating me, so I quit. I couldn't beat Anna, even with 
          her own character.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterwards, my parents got 
          home, and soon after, I took a nap. When I got up, I started some dinner, 
          and then we watched the presidential speech. The war is finally over...or 
          at least the major part of the fighting. I am sad to say that I haven't 
          been keeping up with the war for the last couple weeks. Oh well...it's 
          over now, and I am sure I will read about it in my kid's history books 
          - if they ever update them.</font></p>
