        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I woke up 
        late, at about 8:45, and was supposed to call Stacy at 8:30. She had 
        been awake since 7:00 this morning, and just didn't get out of bed until 
        8:30 or so. So, I went to her house to get her about 9:15, and brought 
        her back to my house.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we got there, I 
        didn't want to clean my room...I wanted to sit with her and spend time 
        with her. So we did, and we played around some, until my dad came up to 
        check on us, and was a little disappointed that we didn't get anything 
        done in my room, as far as moving my things in. So I put together a 
        shelf and put my software on it, as well as my music.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We worked for about 30 
        minutes, or so, and then we went to the park for a spontaneous picnic. 
        We had some of the cold cuts from the weekend, and some sodas. It was a 
        nice day out, except for the fact that it got humid when it didn't rain, 
        and just sprinkled. So we only stayed at the park for a little bit - 
        primarily because I told my parents a time that I would be back, and 
        because I had to go to work, with enough time to drop her off at her 
        house on the way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work tonight, I was 
        Amber's runner...and I will never again fill that position. She was 
        doing well with getting the orders accurate on the screen, but I noticed 
        that she was having trouble with putting some of the specifics on there 
        so that I could make it like the people wanted. So, I told her &quot;I hope 
        you are putting them on there right, so I don't have to make them 
        again...&quot; And she said, &quot;I hope you are reading them right.&quot; And from 
        that point on, she left out several specifics for the orders that caused 
        me a lot of problems, especially since the vanilla ice cream, which is 
        in just about everything, was rock hard. It as terrible tonight...but 
        now that I am home, I feel better, because I can rest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I called Stacy tonight, 
        and her phone died after a 20 minute conversation. It's ok though, 
        because she needs to sleep, as well as I do. I also looked at my 
        computer, and it stopped at 35% for the formatting, and said &quot;Disk not 
        ready. Formatting Terminated.&quot; Stupid homosexual computer. I told it it 
        had better get past 35% by the time I got home tonight (it was at 32% at 
        that time)...and it stops right on 35%. Crazy thing. I am restarting the 
        format, to see what happens, and hopefully it will work, or go through 
        the stuff it has already done a lot quicker.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">That's all for tonight. I 
        have to go to work tomorrow morning, so I am going to bed early tonight.

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">It's Sunday, and I am back 
          at home now...finally. This morning, I had some quiche. It was interesting. 
          I don't eat quiche...ever. I just don't like it. But since it was all 
          there was, I humored my grandmother, and ate some. I didn't even wrinkly 
          my nose - that much. After breakfast, I decided to do a little fishing...but 
          since the fish are mostly dead, it was more of playing in the water, 
          than anything else. So I came back inside, and watched the races with 
          everyone else. I soon after fell asleep. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">For some reason I woke up 
          and then my cousin, her fiancé and I went over to their chalet and 
          we watched X-Men. It was a pretty good movie. I kinda want to see the 
          second one now. But they recommended seeing it in the theaters, because 
          of all the special effects. Then we watched Big Daddy. It was a meaningful 
          movie for Adam Sandler. It showed a more mature side of him as a father 
          figure. It was a pretty good movie as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Then we all headed back 
          and went on the boat, for a ride. We went to an island in the lake, 
          and the grandkids (everyone but me, that is) decided that they would 
          go swimming in the lake. It is no where near warm enough to get in that 
          lake. But I knew that, and they didn't apparently. It was cold, but 
          they swam anyway. On our way back home, the boat stalled right in front 
          of the dock that we needed to be on. So we had to paddle in and steer 
          around the trees in the water, and dodge the edges of the docks in our 
          down current path. It was challenging.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, we went inside, 
          and prepared for dinner, and the races came on again. This time I heard 
          the floor calling my name, and I went to lay down on it to listen, and 
          fell asleep...again. It seems that every time the races come on, I fall 
          asleep. I guess that is why my stereo is banging in my car, and my A/C 
          is a full blast, so that the lull of the car doesn't put me to sleep.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Some tie later, my other 
          cousin and his wife came by, and we talked briefly before we had to 
          leave. He is starting his own web design business...something close 
          to what I want to do, and have done, I just haven't marketed it to do 
          it for other people at the moment. (I think I have too many other things 
          to do for now, instead of working on other people's websites) I barely 
          have time to get anywhere with my own.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got home tonight 
          I was so excited, so I put together my desk, which took an entire hour. 
          Then I called Stacy and we talked for an hour, until her phone died. 
          At that point, I finally got my computers hooked up, and was SADLY DISAPPOINTED 
          to see that MY computer has crashed and the one from DQ works. There 
          is nothing on the DQ computer, other than Office 97 Professional, and 
          some DQ applications. So, I removed those, and the files that pertained 
          to DQ. This computer is substantially slower than mine, and has a 1.12 
          Gig HD, AMD Athalon K6 (and I have no idea how fast that is, but it 
          doesn't crawl, that I know of...I haven't really used it that much.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, I am sleepy now, 
          so that is all for tonight. I have to get up early to get Stacy and 
          bring her over so we can hang out. We haven't seen each other in 3 days. 
          It's torture. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ahh...adventures in the 
          U-Haul. Mike and Lara rode with us (in their own truck) down to Hubbard 
          to get my things. We rode in the U-Haul truck. It was a P.O.S.! The 
          side mirrors didn't work, and the car had a governor on it that didn't 
          let it get up past 65 mph, unless you were going downhill, when it reached 
          a maximum of 70. This fact didn't allow for a constant speed, since 
          when you were going consistently at 65, any hill, up or down, would 
          alter your speed considerably. I did notice a number of WARNING signs 
          in the car, like &quot;Door will not open if locked.&quot; Or &quot;How 
          to use the gear shift.&quot; They made me want to say &quot;Here's your 
          sign.&quot; That was, until I read one about bumping your head on the 
          &quot;Mom's Attic&quot; that hung over the door...I know I read it at 
          least 7 times, but when I got out of the car - *BAM!!!* I smacked the 
          top of my head on the Mom's Attic. Then I did it again when I got out 
          a second time. You would think that I learned my lesson the first time, 
          or even before that since I read all the warnings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Anyway, when we got there, 
          there were no problems getting my things. They were all laid out on 
          the lawn, with a tarp over them so they wouldn't get wet, and so people 
          wouldn't stop by thinking it was a garage sale. I didn't get to see 
          my mom, or siblings though. Oh well...my brother was probably at work, 
          and my sister was probably with my mom somewhere.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We loaded everything up 
          into the U-Haul, which made Mike and Lara's trip essentially pointless, 
          since we didn't have to have their truck. Oh well...it only took us 
          15 minutes with the three of us loading, and my dad arranging in the 
          truck. And then we were off again. This time I got to drive my own car! 
          Hehe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When we got back home, we 
          unloaded everything into the garage, and then we headed out for 
        Granbury. 
          We were the first of the relatives to arrive, other than the grandparents. 
          Then came my uncle and his crew. Something strange caught my attention 
          though the moment I saw my cousin. Although I wasn't quite sure what 
          it was exactly...then it hit me. Apparently the whole family knew, or 
          some of them at least, but not me. She has turned lesbian...and brought 
          her &quot;girlfriend&quot; with her to the reunion. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          It was something that I picked up on automatically. And it is disappointing 
          to see that happen to my family.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today, was generally boring...since 
          I didn't have Stacy with me, and I didn't know these people very well, 
          and they all brought their &quot;other halves&quot; with them. I offered 
          for Stacy to come, but she thought she would feel out of place. I thought 
          she might too, but apparently it would have been no problem. (We would 
          have spent a good majority of our time together, instead of me with 
          my family, though.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Kristopher and I watched 
          Anti-Trust on his computer. It is a pretty good movie, and one that 
          I have been wanting to see for a while. He and I are going to get together 
          and swap software, and such soon - probably this weekend - now that 
          I have mine here with me. I can't wait to get back to the house and 
          get on my computer. I haven't touched it since I left college. Anyway, 
          that is all for tonight. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">*Yawn* Man, I'm sleepy, 
          so I will try to make this quick. Today, I didn't do jack. I watched 
          The Saint, with Val Kilmer, and then wrote Stacy a letter. Afterward, 
          I got ready for work, and my sister was late picking me up. But that 
          was ok, because I was talking to Stacy on the phone before I left to 
          go to work, incase she wasn't coming in for her sister.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I am not going to see her 
          after tonight until Monday, unless she comes in on Friday to see me. 
          It will be torture! Hehe...I just have to think what I would have done 
          before she and I met...which wasn't much. I am going to go to her school 
          tomorrow, to see where it is, and how to get there. It has been cool 
          outside recently, so it shouldn't be too much torture for a 2-hour bike 
          ride. I'm gonna miss her this weekend. And she says that nothing is 
          going to stop her from seeing me on Monday morning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight at work it was semi-busy. 
          When it is cool outside, people don't want much ice cream. I have realized 
          that as long as there is either someone there to tell the people what 
          to do, or the people don't need to be told what to do, I have no problem 
          going around behind the scenes taking care of the managerial business. 
          Stacy and I didn't get to flirt tonight. It was kinda sad that we didn't 
          get to flirt. Oh well. We do have a date to see Bruce Almighty on Wednesday 
          next week, as well as take care of some of her personal business (i.e. 
          bank account, phone, etc.), and then we will spend some time together 
          at the mall, wandering around the stores until the movie starts.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today seemed very productive. 
          I got up this morning, called my student loan people, and got the information 
          for my student load payment deferment. Then I called my step dad to 
          get the details worked out for my transfer of belongings this weekend. 
          After that I got online and talked to my dad about the U-Haul reservation 
          situation. That was the productive part of my day, as far as serious 
          matters go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also worked on the home 
          page of the-spot.net, and got a new muzak script going, as well as some 
          more music for it. While I was doing this, Beth came online and we talked 
          some. But for some reason, I don't have much to talk about with my friends 
          anymore. It's sad.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I did laundry today, because 
          I got muddy from my ride home last night. And then I was off to work 
          - in the rain, once again. Today was slow too. We didn't have many people 
          come inside, but a ton of people (still not as many to be considered 
          &quot;busy&quot;) came through the drive through. My assistant just 
          found out she was pregnant today, and she was sick. So she laid on the 
          bench to a lobby table, and I had to run the floor tonight. The people 
          didn't want to do their work, they just wanted to talk. It was 
        frustrating. 
          If I could, I would have fired a good majority of them tonight for insubordination. 
          I told one kid to get a headset on 5 times. (And they wondered why we 
          weren't speaking to them nicer...it's because when we do, they don't 
          listen!) I was impressed with Stacy tonight though. She always had a 
          rag in her hand and was constantly working. I am going to do what I 
          can to get her promoted to a crew manager or something. She is about 
          the only one up there that doesn't complain about doing work, and always 
          finds something to do, and does a good job at it. (That is another reason 
          that I am attracted to her...good work ethics.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I don't have much to say 
          about today. But I did get the random image script finished for the 
          forums, and informed Gigz, of Animekingdom.net, that I finished it, 
          and would get it to him when he is ready for it. So that's about it 
          for today. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Work today was so slow...on 
          account of the rain that I had to ride my bike to work in. When I got 
          there, I was soaked. It was cold, so a simple poncho wouldn't do, so 
          I got a jacket, and this windbreaker absorbs water, it doesn't shield 
          from it. But it was ok though, I guess. We were incredibly slow, so 
          I didn't have to do much work today. However, even though we were slow, 
          the girls (middle aged women, is more accurate) I worked with all complained 
          and cried. See, we didn't have much to do during the good portion of 
          the day until about 4:00. So before 4:00 they all hung out and smoked, 
          etc. Taking their break basically. But when 4:00 came around I had things 
          to do, like count the registers, and then we got customers. So they 
          kept saying &quot;Chris, I need help on drive...I'm my own runner.&quot; 
          or &quot;Chris, we need you up front please.&quot; .oO(They don't call 
          the other assistant manager when she is back here counting money. And 
          they know that I can't leave the money just lying back here.) So that 
          frustrated me. And then they wanted to take their breaks. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          They've already had their break! They don't get two. So then one of 
          them threw a fit in front of the manager, and they went back and forth 
          in the office while I was counting the money. I wanted to fire the woman, 
          both of them actually...it wouldn't make any difference to me. I would 
          just get more money.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">A crazy thing happened today 
          though. One of those women (the one that didn't throw the fit) asked 
          me if I wanted to go do something with her when she got off work. <img src="../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          First of all, she is married...second of all, she is in her 30's at 
          least, or looks like it. Thirdly, I have a girlfriend, even though they 
          don't know it. Fourthly, UGH! I don't even find her attractive. She 
          is a drunk, with her front teeth missing, and...UGH! So I never gave 
          her a direct answer. Just that I had plans tonight. Which I did...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After work...which was extended, 
          because my boss went to his house to get his coat for about 30 minutes 
          - &quot;I'll be back in two minutes&quot; Yeah, riiight. But I finally 
          got to leave, and since it was later than I had expected, I decided 
          that I would just go by Stacy's since I was only 5 minutes away anyway, 
          and see her. So, we took a walk, and I told her what happened today, 
          and how one of the crew managers made a pass at me...she was disgusted 
          as much as I was/am. We talked and walked around her neighborhood, and 
          then made it back to her house, where we sat on the front porch. It 
          was a nice day after the rain. It brought a cool front in. But we sat 
          and talked, and hugged...and today, I have not gotten so many kisses 
          in one day, or in my entire life. At least 100, I'd say. But the time 
          flew by rather quickly. Before I knew it it was 8:00, and I hadn't gone 
          home yet. So I tried to leave, but couldn't bring myself to do it until 
          about 8:30. Because, after all, we weren't going to be seeing each other 
          in romantic setting until next Monday - 6 days away.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">On my way home, I got stuck 
          in the mud. Apparently it slipped my mind that it had rained this morning, 
          when I drove through the parking lot of the library that is being built 
          by my house. The parking lot is dirt - now mud. And when I got home, 
          my parents were upset that they didn't know where I was. I thought that 
          I should have called them while I was at Stacy's house, but I didn't 
          really expect to spend the whole evening over there. I just wanted to 
          come buy, say hello, get my pen, and be on my way...but I couldn't resist, 
          I had to spend time with her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got online tonight, 
          I talked to a bunch of people that I hadn't talked to in a while: Robin, 
          Laura, Amy, Brian Hatch, and Chris Crawford. I also got the script for 
          a jukebox for my home page...I don't know how well it will work though, 
          but it is worth a shot tomorrow while I am at home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I do have some things to 
          do tomorrow, but I think that I am also going to go and see how far 
          it is to Stacy's school. Hmm...I will have to think about it. I have 
          to go to work at 3:00, and I don't want to be worn out. I may just wait 
          until I have my car this weekend, and go to eat lunch with her on Tuesday. 
          What stinks is that one week from Monday, she is out of school, but 
          that is the day that I start school. I suppose that we could spend the 
          afternoons together between 2:00 and work. That's not much time, but 
          it is some time. The good thing is that I don't have school on Fridays, 
          and hopefully no work on Friday mornings, so that could be out together 
          time, or my homework time. I am going to have to schedule my homework 
          time and dating time and working time all before I actually go to school, 
          so that I will actually do it, and not mess up like I did last semester 
          at etbu. My first semester I had everything planned out, and made a 
          4.0. I know that I can do it, and intend to do it this summer, and for 
          the rest of my college career. I also have to call the loan people and 
          tell them that I am a student now, and that I can't start paying on 
          my loans.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Today, I went all around 
          the southeastern quadrant of Arlington, on my bike. I left at about 
          11:00 a.m. to go to the mall to buy my movie ticket, according to my 
          plans, and decided to bop around the mall while I was there to cool 
          off and check out what's new. I stopped by Frulatti, and got a Strawberry-Peach 
          Fruit Chiller - which was good. Then I stopped by Sears to see what 
          they know, and found myself in the electronics section, looking at the 
          flat screen TVs and playing the X-Box. When I lost the game, I left 
          for the food courts to grab a bit to eat. I had a craving for some carbs 
          - so I went to Subway and got a crab salad sandwich.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After that, I got to thinking, 
          I need to know how they are going to go about this carding for tonight...so 
          I know what to do. So, I went back and asked the guy at the ticket reception 
          desk. He said that I have to be 21 to get two people in, or she has 
          to be 18 to get herself in. That stunk. I almost asked for my money 
          back, since I couldn't see the movie with her - but I didn't. I decided 
          to think about it, and work out this grand scheme...that wasn't so grand, 
          but worked.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I walked away from the ticket 
          booth and around the mall for about 5-10 minutes while I thought it 
          over. .oO(Someone could take us and buy our tickets - nah, too much 
          trouble. I could make her a fake ID - nah, way too much trouble, and 
          not enough time. Or...yes, I'll do that. I'll buy a ticket for another 
          movie at the same time, and we go in separately. That'll do!) And that's 
          what I did.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So, I left the mall after 
          that, and went on my trek home. I stopped by the Braum's to get a drink 
          of water, and then continued on my way to Stacy's house, just to see 
          how long it takes from Braum's to her place, on bike. It takes all of 
          5 minutes. On the way back home, I decided I would take a scenic route, 
          and go down a street that supposedly runs behind my house. I quickly 
          found out that it didn't when I had gone about 400 feet downhill to 
          a dead end. Then I had to pedal back up hill to get out. On the way 
          back up, I noticed a cell phone that was busted up...then I noticed 
          all the pieces laying close by. So I decided to pick it up and see if 
          I couldn't put it back together eventually when I got back home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">When I got home, I took 
          a 30 minute bath. I don't like baths, and I haven't taken one in years. 
          I always take showers, and now I know why. There isn't anything to do 
          in the bath tub. Afterward, I watched Sweet Home Alabama. It was a pretty 
          good movie, but nothing like I had expected it to be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At about 5:45, I left to 
          go get Stacy. Her sister needed to go to the Walmart for her mom, so 
          I decided to take them. Then we were on our way about 6:30. We go to 
          the movie theater, and I told Stacy to wait out of sight by the elevator, 
          while I go get her ticket. She knew the plan, and executed it wonderfully. 
          I went to get the ticket, and she waited. When I gave it to her, I told 
          her what the guy would say, and to just look for room 18, and go in 
          there after a bit...find a seat somewhere in the middle, and wait for 
          me - I would be in there in 5 minutes. She left, and about 30 seconds 
          later, I went up. She had already disappeared from sight by the time 
          I reached the top. I gave the guy my ticket, and he didn't even card 
          me! What a waste of time. Oh well, I went in to the theater, and waited 
          to find Stacy. She came in after me...she had gone to the bathroom for 
          a sec, so they wouldn't notice her walking right into the Matrix room...which 
          was right by the exit. (I didn't know where it was, but she thought 
          well on her feet.) So we sat in the middle somewhere, and watched the 
          movie.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">It was good, but not the 
          best. I thought it was more of a part 1 of a part 2, with the part 2 
          of part 2 coming out in the fall. The fight scenes were long...but had 
          they been shorter, it wouldn't have been so great...had the been longer, 
          it wouldn't have been so great. I like longer, because if I get bored, 
          I can always go to the bathroom at that time. A lot of the scenes were 
          frustrating, like &quot;this shouldn't be happening&quot; or &quot;what 
          is going on?&quot; But it all made sense in the end, if you can call 
          it an end. It was more of a cliff hanger ending. So, I am going to see 
          the third one...so I can see what happens to me (Neo).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After the movie, Stacy and 
          I bopped around the closed mall, and looked at all the stores there. 
          She has never been to the mall before, and this mall is considerably 
          bigger than the one in Boston...which I find odd...since we have 4 of 
          them and are considerably smaller than Boston. Anyway, that is our next 
          outing...going to the mall tomorrow night to browse the stores. And 
          with that, I am out...I need sleep. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Ahh...Sunday. Oh, I have 
          to work today. Poop. I'll get to see Stacy...but I can't do anything 
          at work...it has to be plutonic, and that's no fun. But I saw her....and 
          apparently she came on early for Lauren, who go to leave early...I dunno...I 
          guess Stacy wanted to be on with me sooner. That's a good thing though. 
          However, I didn't even know that she came in because I was working with 
          the truck that we got in this morning. I had to rearrange all the ice 
          cream squares. Now they all look nice and neat.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also had to pressure wash 
          the side walks, and the drive thru (I did the drive thru on my own volition 
          because I was enjoying it.) While I was doing that, I found a small 
          lizard, that I was able to pick up and put in a cup. Whoo Hoo...now 
          I have another pet. I let Stacy name this one, and the best she could 
          do was Sputnik...mistake? Nah, it doesn't matter. I, however, do not 
          know how to take care of a lizard, and am not quite sure what to feed 
          it. I could put ants in his cage, but I am afraid they might eat him. 
          Oh, well...my parents don't like lizards, they say they are too close 
          to snakes...but they don't know that I have him yet... <img src="../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          .</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I got some disturbing news 
          about my date that I am to take tomorrow night...the theaters are starting 
          to crack down on the carding for the rated R movies. The problem there 
          is that Stacy is under 18...I am under 21. She will be carded, and can't 
          buy a ticket. I can't buy two tickets because I am under 21, but I can 
          buy one. So I will have to go to the theater in the mid-day and get 
          a ticket, and then go in the evening when we go, and get another for 
          myself. I will just give her mine from the mid-day. Unless, her friend 
          that works at the theater can let her slide with the carding deal...but 
          that is a long shot if she is even working that night, plus selling 
          tickets. Oh well...my plan will work, even if her's doesn't. Otherwise, 
          we will just go to my house and watch another movie. I have tons of 
          them from my 3rd semester of college...Bless you, T3 connection.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Tonight, Stacy and I had 
          our first get together at my house...kinda like a date, but it wasn't 
          financed by me. After work, she came over and we (or I) had pizza, and 
          we watched Drumline...most of it <img src="../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . It is a good show. I had to watch the last half again after she left 
          because we got to talking, and I didn't get to see it (I like to actually 
          watch the movie when I go to one...that is the purpose of going to one, 
          don't you think?).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">She brought up in random 
          conversation that she and I would have beautiful babies. .oO(Hmm...I 
          guess that means something...I bet she would marry me if I asked.) So 
          I asked her hypothetically...she said, if I asked right now, she would 
          say yes. Hmm, that's great. That's one less thing I have to worry about 
          later in life. But she and I both agree that there is a lot more time 
          that needs to be spent before something like that takes place...like 
          first of all, I would need to be able to financially support myself, 
          her and a child (even if we don't have one right off...which I don't 
          think we would.) And secondly, there are still a lot of things she doesn't 
          know about me, and I don't know about her. So like I said, we have plenty 
          of time left before something like that is to be considered.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">We had a blast tonight. 
          I got to go get her in the Blazer, and take her back by myself. Fun 
          stuff. Every time I leave to go to her house, the radio ALWAYS plays 
          Eminem's Sing for the Moment. It's crazy. She says it is her favorite 
          song. I like it too...but I wish they would play something different 
          each time. Oh well... I think it is neat.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I guess that is all for

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">This morning, I got up...after 
          3:45 hours of sleep...and went to Stacy's. We spent the whole morning, 
          until about 1:00, there at her house, chillin' and (more or less) watching 
          Catch Me If You Can. I can't watch a movie with her...there are so many 
          other things that we could (and do) do that draw our attention from 
          the movie. I brought her my pictures, and took some of her and I on 
          my digital camera, but I can't get them on my computer until I actually 
          get MY computer. The software and the cables are at my mom's house.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Afterward, I had to go to 
          work, but it was ok, because I got to work with, yes, Stacy. We did 
          drive through tonight, which was interesting. Tonight, I had to work 
          with ALL the new people, and with an assistant manager that had not 
          been there in 2 weeks. It was frustrating, and interesting. I did get 
          to train 3 people how to make all the ice creams in the store...which 
          didn't take but 15-30 minutes, depending on the person. Now, if only 
          someone had trained me like that, I wouldn't have had to wait as long 
          as I did to learn everything. (But that is ok, because I finished my 
          6-week floor training in 4 days...which is DANG GOOD!)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">After work, yes, I called

          I don't think I have gone a day at all without talking to her, or seeing 
          her in over a week - 7 days for sure. So, other than work, and going 
          to Stacy's, nothing much happened. So that is all for tonight. Laterz.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">Well, I got up at 5:00 this 
          morning, to get ready for my bike ride. But as it turned out, it was 
          thundering and lightening. So I decided to call before I actually got 
          into the shower...no one answered the phone. Lauren had the phone with 
          her in the bathroom, but she didn't bother to answer it. Stupid girl. 
          Stacy thought it was sweet that someone would get up at 5:00 just to 
          talk to her.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">So I went back to bed, since 
          they didn't answer, and slept until 1:00. At that time, I decided to 
          play some Tekken, and beat it three times on the hardest level. During 
          that time, Amy called, while she was at the bank with her mom. She is 
          going to come see me on the 1st of June before she goes to North Dakota 
          for the summer. I have told Stacy about it, and I hope she is ok with 
          it...she knows that I am not going to cheat on her, and besides, Amy 
          is one of my best friends...oh well. I trust her, I think she trusts 
          me. But after that, I couldn't beat the Kunimitsu that I was playing 
          against, so I quit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">My sister came home, and 
          had rented Catch Me If You Can, and Drumline, as well as Harry Potter 
          (which I don't care to see) so we watched Catch Me. It wasn't as good 
          and fast paced as the previews portrayed it to be, but it was good, 
          nonetheless. Stacy wanted to see it too, so I am going to take it with 
          me tomorrow and we'll watch it over there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I called her in the middle 
          of the movie so we could talk before we went to work today, since I 
          didn't get to talk to her last night. And we talked, once again, until 
          her phone went dead. She was supposed to get a new one last night, but 
          she didn't because her and her mom were pressed for time to get home 
          and watch Friends... <img src="../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
          . Oh well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">At work tonight, she and 
          I worked the drive thru...it wasn't as interesting as I had hoped for. 
          We were pretty busy, and things didn't go as I had planned them to. 
          I did get a note from her, and she got my two letters. One of which 
          was to explain my intentions, and the other told how I felt about her. 
          She read them when she got home, and when I called, she was excited. 
          We are now in agreement that we love each other. Good stuff. She had 
          been wanting to tell it to me since we started seeing each other seriously, 
          but didn't because of my rule. I decided I could break my rule if I 
          had a good enough reason to, and felt that I really did. She felt the 
          same way, that she doesn't say it unless she really means it. Wonderful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I also found out some more 
          good news tonight. I am going to be made into an Assistant Manager of 
          Braum's sooner than I am supposed to. Within a few weeks from now, I 
          will be trained and given keys and codes to become a nighttime assistant 
          manager, plus a pay raise. Wonderful! This was the main reason that 
          I didn't quit on the second day of the job...I knew that there was a 
          bigger purpose that they were so interested in me working there, so 
          I stuck it out...and look, I ended up with a good job, and an excellent 
          girlfriend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana">I am going to see her tomorrow 
          morning, so I had best get to sleep. I will have to get up in 5 hours 
          to get ready and such, so I'm outty. Laterz.</font></p>

            &quot;There were two mice that fell into a bucket of cream. The first 
            one gave up immediately, and drowned and died. The second kept paddling 
            and trying, and eventually turned that bucket of cream into butter, 
            and crawled out. I am that second mouse.&quot; - Christopher Walken,
