the-spot.net v1 - by neotsn

== Description ==
This is a historical repository of the first version of the-spot.net I created.

== Purpose ==
It was done in html, with the intent to migrate the work I did for etbustudents.cc to
switch from Yahoo eGroups to a phpBB forum installation to create a social website for
students from all over the world, and foster a safe online environment where the topic
du jour could be discussed.

== Editing and Commits ==
There is nothing to edit and commit to this, except for maybe the odd update from my end
as the creator.
